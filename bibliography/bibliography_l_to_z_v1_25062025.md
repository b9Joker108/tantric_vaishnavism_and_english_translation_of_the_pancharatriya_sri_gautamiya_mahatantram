Four-armed Shrimati Sarasvati (c. 10th - 11th century), image by The Walters Art Museum, with a (cc) Creative Commons Licence. Carved from soapstone native to Uttar Pradesh, Northern India, where the sculpture was also initially sited. Sculpture dimensions sans base: height: 71.2 cm; width: 55.6 cm; depth: 24.4 cm. Acquired in Varanasi (?), India, in 1969 by The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, Maryland, U. S. A. The Goddess of Music, Learning and the Arts, plucks the Veena, a stringed musical instrument, whilst holding a palm leaf manuscript in Her left rear hand, which rests on the calve of Her left leg. The divine attribute of the Manuscript, alludes to Her domain of Knowledge, particularly Sacred Knowledge, which the goddess guards and protects. Maa Saraswathi is worshipped pervasively throughout the Dharmic Traditions, within the Sanatana Dharma (Hindus), Jaina Dharma and Buddhists Dharma traditions, amongst others, all of which worship Sarasvati, having adapted Her from earlier Animist traditions, which held that all natural objects are sentient and enspirited and have a spiritual nature or essence. Sarasvathi, takes Her name from a formerly significant river in India, that once flower all the way to the coast (now largely dry, though flows intermittently, post-deluge). Maa Sarasvati is an ancient riverine deity, who personifies the abundant gifts and bounty bestowed by the river, not least of which was the provision of life-giving water to support life in the region, and also the provision of invaluable irrigation for crops and livestock. Legends of Her beneficence extended to Her bestowal of Knowledge, the Divine Word (from Sri Vac Devi, with whom She synchronised), and Sound, to humankind, especially amongst later Sanatana Dharma (Hindu) traditions. ‡•ê ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ê‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡•ê ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à ‡§®‡§Æ‡§É ||

# Annotated Bibliography (3B: L - Z) of the English translation of the 'Gautamiya Samhita' or 'Gautamiya Mahatantram', a Vaishnava Tantric Pancharatra Agama, with extensive Frontmatter & Introduction #

by Sri Nagahari-dasa a.k.a. Beauford A. Stenberg

**Note:** The (1A & 1B): Frontmatter and extensive Introduction and Survey-of-the- Field the (2A & 2B): Sanskrit original and Hindi commentary, along with annotations, English translation, analysis and commentary, will be complemented by (3A: A‚Ää-‚ÄäK & 3B: L -Z): this Annotated Bibliography. All three (3) will be progressively and incrementally published in Medium separately, as complimentary living documents, due to publication number-of-word restrictions per published page, according to Medium (online) Webmaster's site policy and the electronic medium, proper. I may also institute (4): An Index of sorts, to collectively house a Table-of-Contents (TOC), and hypertext linkages, to assist ease of electronic navigation and wayfinding, for my audience. I have resolved not to place this work behind a paywall. That said, I reserve the right to review that determination in future, once the work has been well-progressed and well onway to realisation.

This item is the fourth of five volumes of a suite. The first volume of which, is my principal secondary resource. It took me circa three (3) weeks of solid work of protracted research and endeavour to realise it. It was not been cited in any work I have so far read. The first volume out of five (5), is effectively a monograph on the Pancharatra as a class. It is the first substantive monographic work on the topic in English, that I have secured. As such, I cherish it greatly as my guiding light and I am actually unwrapping it ever-so-slowly, savouring and integrating each sip of the nectarine elixir and fully digesting it, before progressing. Actually, before fully progressing my study of this work and progressing with the Gautamiya Mahatantram translation, I have somewhat been seduced into translating an emic Hindi work on Vaishnava Tantra, geared towards academically oriented to the cohort of the young adult Vaishnava, but is of course useful for those outside this cohort, as an entry into the topic, and the doctrine and sadhana proper, which it treates. I actually anticipate, that I will progress the translations incrementally in tandem. NB: Beauford, reference and file the other four (4) volumes.

As soon as I saw "sƒÅttƒÅda", my intuition told me it was a Romanised Tamilization with diacritics, of the Sanskrit "sƒÅtvata" or "sƒÅttvata". On reading the article, Lester surrenders this point, but only in passing.

This work is definitely informed by the vast amount of work and citations, I uploaded and published in English Wikipedia, from a number of articles, but particularly the now renamed and defunct English Wikipedia article that I inaugurated, populated and cited, and named 'Kƒ´lƒÅ (Sanskrit)', later changed by others to 'Buddhism', which I disagreed with. Even Boord personally contributed to the article, amongst other Tibetologists and Sanskritists. This dissertation even utilises some of my specific terms of phrase, unattributed. My writing and referencing style is idiosyncratic and distinctive. Especially, when my writing is decidedly polished, through much toil. I consider myself a jeweller. I write, often spontaneously. Then, slowly, meticulously, painstakingly and methodologically: facet, filigree, and fashion cabochons and cameos of concept and language. I find it annoying and disconcerting, that some scholars, such as Li, feel they do not need to cite Wikipedia, when their work has drawn and benefited extensively from it. I feel, and it is my concerted opinion, that the time has long since passed when Academia and the bastions of scholarship, could deprecate and disparage the contribution of the suite of Wikimedia projects, and all those (mostly) anonymous, selfless, contributions, of mostly non-academically trained, non-professionals, to iterate and inform global discourse, knowledge and information dissemination, and the subsequent leavening of the global scholarship of Academia and institutional pedagogy and traditions of scholarship. The Wikimedia projects and their synthesis and showcase of human knowledges and discourse confluence, has profoundly altered the 'Human Condition' and 'The Spirit of the Age', since its inception. Well, this position, I tender, proffer and defend.

"This dissertation deals with the PƒÅdmasamhitƒÅ (PƒÅdS), a Sanskrit work of South Indian origin, belonging to the PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra, composed between the XII and XIII century A. D.. Information about the period and features of composition of the work, its structure and contents is given in the Introduction of the dissertation; methodological issues and the chief results of the research are also therein discussed. The first part is devoted to philosophical and theological teachings of the PƒÅdS. The chapter on the doctrine of God deals with the concept of the threefold manifestation (i.e. the Highest VƒÅsudeva, puru≈üa and prak≈óti) of the Supreme Being, which is influenced by YƒÅdavaprakƒÅ≈õa's idea of the unfolding of brahman in its three manifestations (a≈Ü≈õa); the relational aspect of the godhead, concretized in the presence of God in meditation and ritual worship, is elucidated. The chapter on the individual soul deals with the origination of the jƒ´va-s, their involvement in sa≈ÜsƒÅra and their striving after emancipation. The chapter on the doctrine of liberation illustrates both the concept of mukti as union between individual souls and Supreme Soul, and the idea of a fourfold liberation. The second part is devoted to yoga. The first two chapters discuss problems concerning the text and structure of the yogapƒÅda and reassess the idea of the "limbs" of yoga. In the third and fourth chapter some elements of subtle physiology, together with certain psycho-physical practices of the yogin are illustrated. The last chapter, devoted to the religious dimension of yoga, discusses the following: the function of the yogic disciplines in the yoga-permeated ritual system of the PƒÅdS; the importance of yogic meditation (dhyƒÅna) in religious life and spiritual experiences of the devotee; the ritual practice of yogic suicide as a means of hastening final emancipation."

No information is provided about editor, publisher, locality or date of this recent independently and self-published edition of the work of Mahadeva that was initially published as a serialised translation, with dates as stated. So, I have attributed a rather curious circa date to the edition as a retrospective, given that for a desktop published affair, it demonstrates technological proficiency and academic precision and has been well-edited and adepty proofed. The technical name for this commentary by Srikantha following Duquette (2021: p. 2), is the 'Sri Brahma-Mimamsa-Bhashya' (Sanskrit: ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø¬†; IAST: ≈örƒ´brahmamƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya).

As per Ramesan (1972: p. 67), we do not know whether Srikantha flourished before or after Ramanuja. Subramuniyaswami (2004, 1998: p. 843) gives the uncited date of circa 1050 CE for Srikantha and that would make him contemporaneous with Ramanuja and then states that the Shaiva Vishishtadvaita was "Patterned after the Vaish·πáavite Vi≈õish·π≠ƒÅdvaita of Ramanuja, this philosophy was later amplified by Appaya Dikshitar.". Duquette (2021: p. 2), after providing details of a number of scholarly works that treat Srikantha and his dates, compositions and commentaries, states that he flourished circa 14th‚Ää-‚Ää15th centuries, so well post-Ramanuja.

This is the edition that first gave the Pancharatriya agamaic Sri Gautamiya Samhita, that I am giving extended attention and treatment to, the appelation "Mahatantram". I sourced and secured this edited text of the principal root scripture of this endeavour as per date accessed, as abovecited. The work does not expressly state it is critically edited, only edited. Given its provenance, that is enough to make this volume, my principal primary resource, for this endeavour. That this work is edited by scholars of an ancient city in Mahabharata Varsha, by Shastri Malaviya, Doctor, Professor and Head of the Samhya-Yoga-Tantra-Agama-Departent, of the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Kashi (Varanasi), and ornamented with a generous Foreward in Sanskrit by Dr. Vidyaniwas Misra, Vice-Chancellor, of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, it is almost unnecessary for it to be expressly stated, but I feel it obligatory, to convey, as follows, in emphasis. The urbanity of Kashi is demonstrably ancient and an esteemed seat of dedicated learning since at least the early medi√¶val era, as known to Western scholarship. But, it may be properly, technically, an ancient, dedicated and uninterruped seat of learning in Great Mother India, since time immemorial. Much, is not recorded in English, nor indeed, in any Western or European language. Their collective private treasury of published and unpublished manuscripts and volumes, including rarities and the rarefied, would be immeasurable, as would their traditional cum modernised mentoring and initiatory systems and reticlum of secret societies and established networks. In addition to what has been aforestated, their interior treasury of secret and reserved volumes and manuscripts, mostly unpublished and many uncatalogued, at least for the Western gaze, must be vast. I tender, many Indic manuscripts held to be no longer extant in Western or European academic scholarship, are indeed in sacred and secreted reserve, in fortified invitation-only libraries in Kashi, amongst other preserves in India. As too, they are in Old Europe, though not as venerable. I feel it to be of particular import, that I have secured this volume, on this particular date. I will confer with a Vedic Astrological almanac, as to the significance of today's date, in my provincial locale. May all be auspicious! ‡ºº Âçê Aum ‡øà Svasti! Âçç ‡ºΩ

The Dharmic Traditions are a complex and they are complex. All the Dharmic Traditions, if not directly formed and founded by traditional debate, were significantly altered by it. They altered each other with and by it. Dharmic debate is traditional within the Dharmic Traditions. These Dharmic debates, were often great affairs and spectacles, with many spectators, and were sometimes conducted with royal patronage and assent. The debates had clear rules that were culturally sanctioned and agreed to by all parties. The debates were visceral; oration, oratory and orality were primary, yet the physicality and actions of the debators conveyed much meaning, and qualified and emphasised what was stated. Much is misunderstood about the Dharmic Traditions, when the primacy and foundational nature of Dharmic debate is not appreciated, understood or misunderstood. This is an interesting work as it looks at aspects of the system as a complex. I recommend having a grounding in NyƒÅya, before engaging with this work.

This article by Matsubara which I happened upon by the grace of goddess Shrimati Serendipity, is likely from a Japanese journal, and it appears to be the first in a series. So, the aspects of the monograph of Matsubara (1994), appears to have been initially or subsequently serialised in a Japanese journal, the specifics of which are yet to be determined. In his monograph, Matsubara cites a suite of his articles, but not any of this series, which is perplexing and a cause of vexation, but may point to the journal serialisation being published subsequent to the monograph.

I first encountered this work in circa 2004, in hardcopy, whilst deep-grazing and serendipitously communing in an inspired and intuitive spontaneity, as was my practice and fashion, a form of sadhana, within a library call-stack of books, stacked and categorised in isles and shelves, in the Dewey decimal system. This sadhana, has defined and informed my life. I first heard the term "call-stack" from the lips of a librarian more than thirty-five (35) years ago, long before its redefinition and inclusion as a denotation and technical term in Computer Science and other academic disciplines, knowledge areas and ontological domains. Anyway, I was profoundly drawn to this work, and borrowed it, and couldn't bring myself to part with it. I paid the library a pretty-penny for its replacement. I cannot commend, nor recommend, this great work enough. I hold McEvilley, in particular esteem, and embrace him as Guru, for this *magnum opus*.

This is the best digitization of the volume I have been able to find. It had a makeshift cover that detracted from the edition. So, I extracted the cover and prepended the true and correct cover I sourced by the grace of goddess Shrimati Serendipity on the weblog of Sri Vishnudut1926. Vishnudut1926 was manifestly delighted with aspects and tracts of the work. I have as yet been unable to determine if this edition is canonical Pancharatra. On a cursory appraisal of its register, it bears no branding, iconography nor otherwise overt information nor salience, attesting to its veracity as Pancharatra. My intuition informs me, in a positive assessment, it is neo-Pancharatra or a faux and derivative work, modelled somewhat on canonical Pancharatra and other agamic and tantric scriptures of comparable nature and concerns. This is not to be considered a determination. If value is found in the work, the work is of value, regardless of what academia, specialists and/or the tradition(s) attest.

Mitra (1875a: pp. 99-101) describes a Sanskrit manuscript of the 'Sri Gautamiya Tantra' (Samhita or Mahatantra) set in Bengali script with a mangala shloka of "Sri Sri Balagopalaya Namah" and then commences with the beginning of: "siddha-ashrame ..." and that is different to the Bengali version I have secured with the mangalala shloka of "Sri Sri Gurave Namah", that commences with the discussion of a mantra. So, there is a Gautama Samhita that is different to the Gautamiya and in addition, there may be two (2) Gautamiya Samhitas, rather than two recensions. Y.T.B.D.

So, I tentatively attributed that date to the bibliographic entry.)

**Purport:**<br>
The Chitrasutra is extracted from the 'Vishnudharmottara Purana'. This article is tangential to our concern on the Pancharatra, but the redactor of the 'Vishnudharmottara Purana' was a Pancharatrin. I gather Mukherji is an artist, as well as an aesthetician, and is interrogating the document through this practitioner-theoretical critical lense, with aspects of a contemporary critical apparatus and non-Indic purview, even though their name bears Indic ancestry. The article emphasises aspects of the text that I would not perceive without it. For this, at minimum, it is useful. It is interesting as the article has made me realise that as a fundamental aspect of the Pancharatrins is deity-work, if not its defining characteristic, they are primarily artisans, if not in the practical sense of material fabrication, but in the sense of theory and philosophy of art to inform that material fabrication, and their concerns subsume iconometry, iconography and iconology, etc. Note, refer: Dave-Mukherji, Parul.

The ‚ÄòCharyagiti‚Äô (xxx) or ‚ÄòCharyapada‚Äô (xxx), is a compendium of lyrical song-poem wisdom-verses in a hybrid complex of languages, often referred to simply as Old Bengali, in the Old Bengali script. Recent scholarship, has defined the language complex further. It contains the earliest known, open discourse and extant Sahajƒ´ya text, or literary example of what is known as the Twilight Language. This work draws principally upon the Charyagiti in its historical analysis and survey of the language and the text.

Without reservation, I determine this a watershed work in the literature. I leaned on it heavily to inform my ritual practice with the Kila post-initiation and empowerment and in writing and citing the historical English Wikipedia 'Vajrakila' article, the substantive content of which has subsequently been split into 'Vajrakilaya' as a ritual tool and 'Dorje Purbha' as the deity of said ritual tool. At this time, there was precious-little academic treatment of Sri Vajrakila in the English language. To me, as a practitioner-scholar, the ishta-devata or yidam and the ritual implement are non-different and other editors, most of which are neither practitioners nor scholars, do not appreciate that finesse. Moreover, my overriding and guiding intentionality, was to maintain the Sanskrit and Indic provenance of the nomenclature and subsume subsequent traditions within that purview to establish a clear spatio-temporal continu√ºm in the presentation. I just feel a calling to add this work to the bibliography. So, rather cavalierly, it has been included. If we come across the term ‚Äúvajra‚Äù in our Tantra, or our commentaries, or the Pancharatriya agamaic samhitas, we will know why. This work is the product of protracted fieldwork. Subsequent to Saturday, June 8, 2024, due to the sublime Grace of goddess Shrimati Serendipity, Our Lady of Luck, I came across "Vakrakila" as the nail-of-adamantium percing the hub and garbha-griha of the Yantra-Chakra-Mandala or 'whorl' of the divine kshetra or loka of Goloka-Vrindavana in the Pancharatriya agmama, the extant fifth chapter of the 'Sri Brahma Samhita', which through divine provenance, was recovered by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in a manner somewhat comparable to the Himalayan terma revelation tradition. I read the Samhita in full at circa nineteen (19) years old, whilst in the Brahmacharya Ashrama and residence of a local Mandhira and attending university and subsequently, after leaving Brahmacharya, chanted the extracted tract of Prayers made by Sri Brahma daily for many, many years, both before and after receiving the esoteric Dzogchen Transmission and the esoteric Dzogchen Pointing-out Instruction. I did not know of Sri 'Vajrakila' when I read the Samhita and neither did the learned and eloquent Sri Srila Bhaktivedanta Saraswati Goswami when they rendered their English-Sanskrit bilingual edition, translation and commentary in academic register and prestige dialect. To find Sri 'Vajrakila' in such an exalted position, was a personal revelation of such profundity, it is presently beyond my capacity to express with fidelity.

Note, Padoux (2000: p. 45) makes reference to Pancharatra in passing: "Some Tantric traditions, notably the dualist Saiva Siddhanta whose scriptures are the Sanskrit Agamas, insist on the absolute and total efficacy of ritual. Such is also the position of the Vaisnava tradition of the Pancaratra, despite the importance given there to devotion to the Lord."

It is an absolute Mystery to me, as well as a Revelation, that I have been working solidly, full-time, every day, for over three and a half (3.5) months, on this endeavour on the Pancharatra and the matter of translating the Sri Gautamiya Samhita (or Mahatantram) with Commentary, from Classical Sanskrit and Hindi into the English, which I am yet to significantly progress, and I only discovered this relatively recent Catalogue by Parampurushdas & Shrutiprakashdasafter (2002), after lunchtime prashadam, on Friday, August 9, 2024, on the day uponwhich I awoke first thing in the morning, with the express instruction from the Realm-of-Dream as a profound compulsion whilst awaking from Swapna Darshan, to write on how the Kaya Siddhi, assists in my research and endeavours and in the particular of knowing that the Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara edition of the Satapatha Brahmana, with two (2) commentaries, all in Sanskrit, set in Devanagari, is of particular import for our endeavours, refer purport to Prasada (1988). So, in reviewing this purport in my mind and editing it in-mind before the fact, I realised I felt it important how today, of all days, I came across this Catalogue. Just after lunch, it just welled in me to search for "pancharatra" in LinkedIn, which I did. The search, first took me to the LinkedIn profile of Prof. Sampathkumar Acharyulu, where I noticed the following: Sampathkumar Acharyulu (2007). 'A note on Vaihayasi Samhita‚Ää-‚ÄäAn Unpublished Pancaratra manuscript' at the 14th World Sanskrit Conference (14thWSC), Kyoto, Japan, 2007. I had previously sent an email to McComas Taylor, Secretary-General of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies, who organise the World Sanskrit Conferences (WSC), regarding securing the unpublished papers and materials from the Agamas and Tantras section of the 14thWSC. Taylor responded promptly to my request for the unpublished papers, by offering to post a call for them on the 'Indology List', which as a non-chartered academic, who is not affiliated with an institution, I may read online, but may not post. It was to this post by Taylor on my behalf, that S.A.S. Sarma responded with his paper the Agamas from the 14thWSC, as no formal publication of the Agama and Tantra proceedings was produced. I received a very important article, for our purposes, from S.A.S. Sarma, for which I am most thankful. Sarma has also been responsive to my unsolicited correspondence requesting assistance, above and beyond the call of duty. Unfortunately, Sampathkumar did not respond with his Note and I have as yet, not been unable to secure or realise it on the Internet. Just after finding out about the Note on LinkedIn, I then found that there has been a publication of the Sri Vaihayasi Samhita. But, it was in searching for this Note on the Internet, that the third response to my search, yielded this Catalogue. So, I secured the Catalogue by the grace of Goddess Shrimati Serendipity.

I just awoke from sleep and dream, Swapna Darshan. I fell asleep last night, well-exhausted from a day of researching and writing endeavour, after just coming across the Laxmi Venkateshwar Steam Press edition of the Sri Shatpath Brahmanam, particularly the Shrimad Vajsaneyi Madhyandin recension, with the Vedarthaprakash Commentary, also known as the Sayana Bhashya, and the commentary by Sri Hariswami, edited by Sridhara Shastri (as per the Internet Archive upload, and who isn't actually given express credit in the publication proper, which only states: "‚Ä¶[e]dited by several learned persons‚Ä¶") and published and printed by Sri Gangavishnu Shrikrishnadass of the Laxmi Venkateshwar Steam Press, Bombay, 1940. Now, I first became aware of the Sri Venkateshwara Steam Press, when researching the edition of the Padma Purana that had been used in the translation of the English version of the Padma. This was an early venture of Gangavishnu, as the name of the company in its early period, was not yet prefixed by Sri 'Laxmi', as it is in the Sri Shatpath Brahmanam of 1940 by Gangavishnu in the Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara edition. The English translation of the Padma Purana only states that it was translated from the "Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara edition", with no further specifics and no citation in the bibliography of the work, which was most curious and truly vexatious from a scholarly point of view, as I then knew nothing of the Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara publishing and printing house. After an inspired and profoundly lucky session of research, even if I say so myself, coupled with focused endeavour, I not only ascertained the specifics of the the edition used, from triangulating a suite of secondary sources that I just fortuitously happened upon, along with a digitised segment of a first edition of the Padma Purana, which upon deciphering the hieroglyphics of the cryptic colophon, was initially published by Gangavishnu of Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara, in a suite of serialised segments as potboilers, prior to collecting the serialised parts and publishing them as a complete edition, which I have as yet not been able to source. In the same research session, I also realised a post-processed electronic version of the complete Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara edition of the Padma, by the grace of the beautiful Goddess Shrimati Serendipity. . I didn't know then, why I felt so powerfully called to add the Sri Padma Purana details to this Annotated Bibliography of my impending translation of the Gautamiya Samhita or Mahatantram of the Pancharatra. Intellectually and conceptually, it seemed tangential and removed from the subject specifics, well at least at first blush. I learnt from that digitised edition of the serialised part-publication of the Padma, that the Venkateshwara Steam Press as a company and business, was actually named after their steam press, 'Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara', named after the deity Sri Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara, or into whom the deity Sri Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara, so important to the Vaikhanasa tradition, may have been ritually installed with the mystical ceremony of the 'prana pratishtha' (Sanskrit: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§æ¬†; IAST: PrƒÅ·πáa Prati·π£·π≠hƒÅ). I just feel that this was done. Anyway, I awoke this morning with the express instruction to write of the Kaya Siddhi and explain how it is a multifaceted accomplishment in terms of its spiritual giftings, virtues and byproducts, in my direct experience. An invocation, glorification and adoration of the Kaya Siddhi, is in the liturgy of Nyingma Dzogchenpa, which I received from my Sri Gurudeva Dharmarajji. I was aware of Kaya Siddhi, prior to my initiation into Dzogchen and formal commencement and undertaking of Dzogchen sadhana, from my Yoga endeavours. In this, the lineage and spiritual technology of the inter-religious and ecumenical Mahasiddha, often referred to as 'Buddhist', are evident, as well as strong, and it also betrays influence from early Hatha Yoga, Shaiva and Shakta Tantras, amongst others. Now, I am not stating that I have fully accomplished and realised the Kaya Siddhi unobstructed, but that I have yielded a mote of its virtue, which has coalesced with the Rasa and Bhava of my Bhakti sadhana, to bring about occurrences of powerful emotional consonance and experience, spontaneously and when encountering certain objects, entities, things, environments, situations and people. Such, when referring to objects, may be understood as a type of psychometry in the English language, from the Greek. My first experience of a welling of the Kaya Siddhi, was during a period of consort practice in esoteric sexual yogas. The welling was a fruit of the sadhana. I didn't write of the sexual yogas or my experiences therewith, as that is personal and private, indeed necessarily secret, though it informed my personal identification as a hierodule, but I wrote of this tangentially when I was in the period of doing express research and study into the nature, state and experience, of the Avadhuta, a class of great saint, common to all of the Dharmic Traditions. My research and devotion had taken me to the Sikhi tradition and the scripture and divine guru and invested deity, the Sri Guru Grantha Sahibji, which contains a section called the Siddha Goshti¬†, which contains a dialogue between Sri Guru Nanak and a coterie of Avadhutas. When I first encountered the Sri Guru Grantha, in an electronic copy, I just couldn't stop crying and I knew not why. It would also happen when I physically touched a print-copy of the sacred scripture. During this period, and after the emotional consonances, I attended Sikhi temples and celebrated their liturgies, honoured their mahaprashadam which is offered to the Sri Guru Grantha, as well as their prashadam, which is sublime. I also circumambulated the Sri Guru Grantha, along with its orator, just as I have done holy people, sacred objects and vigraha and thakura of deities and murti of saints and holy people, throughout my life. I even showered, took refuge, respite and slept overnight in Yoga Nidra, in one of their two very closely sited guruwarras, whilst I travelled on pilgrimage from Melbourne to Cairns onfoot, as well as hitched. The emotions I experienced were sublime and complex. The commingling of so many emotions, but such agony-grief and blissful joy at-once, and tears-of-joy and tears-of-anguish, were overwhelming and a wonder. All of this narrative, was to affirm that this is how I know that the Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara edition of the Satapatha Brahmana 'Vajsaneyi' with two commentaries, will be my favoured and privileged edition, in my research into the Pancharatra and the translation of the Gautamiya, as it contains the esoteric information as to the nature of Sri Vishnu's sacrifice and that of the sage Sri Narayana, that underwent apotheosis into deity-hood. I now also appreciate, that Ve·πÖka·π≠e≈õvara Steam Press, became a very successful publishers from the initial rough, rudimentary and makeshift quality of the partial serialised publication of the Padma, to the quality of the edition of the Satapatha Brahmana mentioned herein, and that they published a lot of Sri Vaishnava materials and scriptures, and importantly for the purposes of this endeavour, many Pancharatra and Vaikhanasa Agamas and Samhitas. Do you perceive how the nature of Kaya Siddhi functions as an experiential confirmation of an emergence what commenced purely on the intuitive level? It is like a spiritual geiger-counter or divining tool. Kaya Siddhi of course has other virtues. If you research, read and recite the Yoga Sutras with devotion and attention, you will identify the passages that refer to it. My favoured edition and translation of the Yoga Sutras will ever-be the Thorsons edition of the Iyengar, first published in 1996, from the first edition published in 1966 by George Allen & Unwin, even though the recent Bryant is worthy of note, due to its synthesis of the extended commentarial tradition. I only came across this edition of the Yoga Sutras by Prasada (1988), after researching on the Kaya Siddhi, tomwrite about it, and searching for "kaya soddhi", led me to the Wisdom Library (online), and their electronic edition and website rendering, of this transaction of the Yoga Sutras, by Prasada. This bilingual edition by Prasada, also includes a splendid treatment of the Patanjali autocommentary in both the original Classical Sanskrit set in Devanagari, with attendant English rendering. It is truly, a work of quality.

This article, along with Raghavan's 'Foreward' to the critical edition of the *Srri Sanatkumara-Samhita* are the most authoritative sources on the meaning of the name, term and denotations of 'Pancharatra'. I noticed non-academic, self-published insider discourse make reference in passing to the *Sri Maha-Sanatkumara-Samhita*, emphasis on Maha, which may denote the Ur text of the extant sections of the *Sri Sanatkumara-Samhita* or it may not. Sometimes, I have noted the prefixture of 'Maha', to denote an additional or different text or recension, as different to the usage without. This ambiguity and play of denotation and referenced scripture is vexing without having a facsimile of the manuscripts in hand or an accomplished study and assessement of same. This insider discourse, also implied that this Maha version, was the ascendant, dominant or principal Pancharatra samhita and held sway even over the Sri Sat\[t]vata Samhita and the balance of the Ratnatraya.

The *Sri Yoni Tantra* has been published in a critical edition, but I have not yet been able to secure it. This bilingual Sanskrit and Hindi edition, is all I have so far been able to realise and even that was challenging. As such, I resolved to commend it to archives, for probity. It appears that the *Sri Yoni Tantra* has received minimal academic treatment. I have not yet engaged the work significantly, but what I have ascertained, marks it of interest. It is a left-handed Tantric work and interestingly, amongst other matters, treats the state of an Avadhuta, which interests me greatly.

Thorns have been placed by others in the path of the ≈örƒ´ PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra. I shall remove them for the pleasure of those who walk this path. The tantra called PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra, which originated from the mouth of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, is especially accepted by the followers of Manu and others." End: "Due to the contradiction with the well-known statements of ItihƒÅsa and PurƒÅ·πáa, such statements are not to be respected. Other objections regarding the authenticity of the ƒÄgamas are also refuted, and thus it concludes. The authenticity of the ≈örƒ´ PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra ≈öƒÅstra, which is not opposed to the Vedas and Sm·πõtis, has been established by the logic of learned persons." Colophon: "Thus ends the collection of the removal of thorns from the ≈örƒ´ PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra. This has been composed for the pleasure of the learned, following the Vedas and Sm·πõtis." Note: The word rendered as "thorn" is "ka·πá·π≠aka" (‡§ï‡§£‡•ç‡§ü‡§ï) in Sanskrit.

Reddy writes the following about her lecture on the OCHS site: "The Vaikhanasas are a small South Indian community of Vaisnava Brahmins who have traditionally engaged in conducting temple worship by following their distinctive ritual system. The name Vaikhanasa derives from Sage Vikhanas, who is attributed with the authorship of the Vaikhanasa Sutras and with the founding of the Vaikhanasa School. The Vaikhanasa regards itself as part of the Vaisnava tradition orthodoxy because of its close adherence to Vedic religion and its presence within the Taittiriya School of the Black Yajurveda. The Vaikhanasa ritual literature on domestic and temple worship both in text and practice reflect this tradition's strong influences from the Srauta sacrificial cult and its fire rituals. This lecture will explore the ways in which the concept of Vedic fires is appropriated in the typical Vaisnava way by formulating a new ritual system for image worship (samurtarcana) in a temple setting within the Vaikhanasa School. We will examine the concepts of Triple Fires (tretagni) and Five Fires (pancagni) within the context of triple images (bimbatrayi) and fivefold images (pancabera). Also considered are the ways in which the Vedic ideas of fire sacrifice are rearticulated with new meanings and interpretations for the theistic, temple-based religion of Visnu as Venkatesvara."

The Sanskrit work edited by Durgaprasada & Peterson in three (3) volumes: Vol. 1 (1882), Vol. 2 (1894) and Vol. 3.

Note: [Stein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurel_Stein), did not pull from the work of Durgaprasada & Peterson. Roy, later in his work, cites and quotes from, the English translation of Stein, which intimates that he may be working from Stein's critical edition, but without investigation, this cannot be taken as a given.

**Purport:**<br>
Sanderson's work is technical, involved, specific, niche and a complex, that employs a sophisticated array of disciplines, subdisciplines, modalities and tools, to analyze the intricate relationships between various specific Tantric and Agamic textual traditions. Here are some of the key technical disciplines and subdisciplines that coalesce in his toolkit:
1. Textual Criticism:
‚Ää-‚ÄäLower Criticism: Focuses on the identification and removal of transcription errors in texts.
‚Ää-‚ÄäHigher Criticism: Deals with questions of authorship, date, and place of composition.
2. Palaeography:
‚Ää-‚ÄäThe study of ancient handwriting and scripts to date and authenticate manuscripts.
3. Manuscript Studies:
‚Ää-‚ÄäCodicology: The study of books and textual material as physical objects, including their structure, materials and production.
‚Ää-‚ÄäPhilology: The study of language in written historical sources; it is a combination of literary studies, history and linguistics.
‚Ää-‚ÄäDigital Philology: Involves the use of digital tools and methods to study manuscripts.
4. Critical Textual Analysis:
‚Ää-‚ÄäStemmatics: The study of the relationships between different manuscript versions to reconstruct the original text.
‚Ää-‚ÄäEclecticism: A method that uses various readings from different manuscripts to create a critical edition.
5. Historical Inquiry:
‚Ää-‚ÄäHistoriography: The study of the methods and principles through which history is written.
6. Theological and Doctrinal Studies:
‚Ää-‚ÄäAnalysis of religious doctrines and their development over time.
7. Forensic Analysis:
‚Ää-‚ÄäApplying scientific methods to analyze and authenticate manuscripts and their origins.
These disciplines collectively enable scholars like Sanderson to meticulously trace the evolution and interconnections of textual traditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of their historical and cultural contexts.
None of these terms, is the specific technical term I seek, in order to describe the technical nature of Sanderson's analytical toolset and acumen. It is like a complex formed from the applications of aspects of Stemmatics, Codicology, Eclecticism and Forensic analysis, in order to show the acculturation and adaptation, dissemination and transmission, of material and theological ideas, insights, narratives, perceptions and theological, conceptual and doctrinal technologies and perspectives, from one sectarian Tantric textual tradition, to another. Given this, I feel Applied Palaeographic Forensic Stemmatics in manuscript intertextuality, approaches a quantification of the toolset or toolkit, employed to great effect by Sanderson in this work.
Phylogenetic methods are analytical techniques originally developed in evolutionary biology to study the relationships between different species based on their genetic characteristics. These methods have been adapted for use in textual criticism to analyze the relationships between different manuscript versions of a text.
In the context of textual criticism, phylogenetic methods involve the following steps:
1. Data Collection: Gathering textual variants from different manuscripts.
2. Alignment: Aligning the textual variants to identify similarities and differences.
3. Tree Construction: Using algorithms to construct a phylogenetic tree that represents the evolutionary relationships between the manuscripts.
4. Analysis: Interpreting the tree to understand the history and transmission of the text.
These methods help scholars to:
- Reconstruct the genealogy of manuscripts.
- Identify common ancestors (archetypes) of different manuscript traditions.
- Understand how texts have evolved and been transmitted over time.
Phylogenetic methods provide a visual and quantitative way to trace the development and divergence of textual traditions, similar to how biologists trace the evolution of species. Sanderson uses "archetype" in this denotation, which perplexed me, as I have not encountered it before.
Forensic Phylogenetic Palaeography?
'Forensic Phylogenetic Palaeography' is an apt term to describe the interdisciplinary approach you're referring to. This term combines several key disciplines:
1. Forensic Analysis: Applying scientific methods to authenticate and analyze manuscripts.
2. Phylogenetic Methods: Using evolutionary biology techniques to trace the relationships and transmission of textual variants.
3. Palaeography: Studying ancient handwriting and scripts to date, authenticate and critically analyze, manuscripts.
This approach allows scholars, such as Sanderson, to meticulously trace the adaptation and integration of textual materials across different traditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of their historical and cultural contexts and intertextuality.
Let us break down some of the technical terms used in this work:
1. Textual Criticism: The scholarly study of manuscripts to determine the original text.
2. Redactor: An editor who compiles and revises texts, often making changes to fit a particular purpose or context.
3. Corpus: A collection of written texts, especially the complete works of a particular author or a body of writing on a specific subject.
4. Recension:
‚Ää-‚ÄäClosed Recension: A situation where the surviving manuscripts of a text are closely related, allowing the editor to reconstruct the archetype (the original form of the text).
‚Ää-‚ÄäOpen Recension: A situation where the manuscripts show significant variation, indicating a more complex transmission history with possible contamination (mixing of different textual traditions).
5. Archetype: The original form of a text from which all copies are derived.
6. Source-Text: The original text from which passages have been borrowed or incorporated into another text.
7. Vertical Structure: The hierarchical relationship between different versions of a text, tracing back to the archetype.
8. Contamination: The mixing of different textual traditions, leading to variations in the manuscripts.
9. Variants: Different readings or versions of a text found in various manuscripts.
10. Forensic Analysis: The application of scientific methods to analyze and authenticate manuscripts.
These terms are used to describe the process of identifying and evaluating the relationships between different manuscripts, particularly when one text has borrowed from another. This helps scholars understand how texts have been transmitted, adapted, and transformed over time.
And: "‚Ä¶beyond the boundaries of the parallel..."?
The phrase "beyond the boundaries of the parallel" in this context refers to the analysis extending beyond the direct textual parallels between the source text and the borrowed text. Here's a breakdown of what this means:
1. Parallel Texts: When one text incorporates passages from another, scholars can identify direct parallels or matches between the two texts.
2. Boundaries of the Parallel: These are the limits within which the texts directly correspond to each other.
3. Beyond the Boundaries: This involves looking at the broader context and implications of these parallels. It means examining how the borrowed text has been adapted, modified, or integrated into the new context, and understanding the wider transmission and transformation of the text.
In essence, it's about moving from simply identifying direct textual matches to understanding the broader historical, cultural, and doctrinal implications of these textual interactions. This approach helps in discerning the deeper layers of textual transmission and adaptation that go beyond the immediate parallels.

This is unsatisfactory filing practice. But, I have not yet resolved how to treat anonymity, traditional or unknown authorship of given works. An excellent source on the pervasive yogic and tantric sadhana and rite of Bhutashuddhi, that has such a profound diversity amongst manifold Dharmic Traditions, and which arguably constitutes an exorcism of the energetic ghosts and phantoms which delude and that which does not serve alignment with one's cultivation of their constitutional position and the Ground-of-Being and constitutes an elemental purification, calling upon the sacred wisdom of the Mahabhutas or the Five Pure Lights to purify ones bodymind and spiritual and ideally divinised continuum.

**Purport:**<br>
This recent work is a collection of discrete fieldwork and ethnographic studies on a suite of avowedly living tantric traditions in Northeast India. I contend the collected selection is not representative of the extant broadly tantric oriented traditions in the geographic designation, only the antinomian and extremist examples of living tantric forms of religio-cultural traditions in the given geographic region and thereby, perpetuates and reinforces the non-representive yet standardardized Tantric trope of the salacious and spurious as well as the Colonial and Postcolonial 'Orientalist' construction of Tantra, coloured and compelled with the clear impetus of the commercial, fiscal and worldly rewards and remuneration and coupled with the populist notoriety, rather than an unskewed, scholarly, balanced abd truly representative inquiry.

(NB: Translated from an undated and unspecified Tibetan text or compendium of text excerpts from multiple sources and/or oral transcriptions.). First edition. Greenview Garden, Hong Kong: Rangjung Yeshe Publications. ISBN 9627341444 (pbk) 

**Purport:**<br>
This stands as an exceptionally valuable resource for the serious practitioner of Dzogchen within the Nyingma tradition. The text offers direct, pragmatic and experiential guidance distilled from oral instructions and written notes by senior disciples of the Rinpoche, presenting the essence of Dzogchen contemplation, conduct and view in a manner that is accessible without sacrificing the profundity of the Rinpoche's original teachings. The translators, compilers and editors, all established figures in the field of Himalayan Bauddhadharma sacred literature, bring a wealth of experiential knowledge and linguistic competence, ensuring that the transmission remains faithful to the living tradition. That said, the publication does not aspire to the standards of academic sophistication nor critical philological rigor of their other work. The source material is acknowledged as composite and, at times, extemporaneous, with the translation prioritizing clarity and immediate applicability over textual criticism or historical contextualization. The editorial apparatus is minimal, lacking extensive footnotes, critical apparatus, or the inclusion of the original Tibetan script or transcription for probity and the book is presented in a standard paperback format typical of practitioner-oriented works from Rangjung Yeshe Publications during this period. Whilst 'Vajra Speech' is indispensable for those seeking practical engagement with Dzogchen pith instructions, it does not constitute a scholarly edition nor a comprehensive critical presentation of the material. Its strength lies in its capacity to communicate the experiential core of the teachings to a contemporary English-literate audience, rather than in that of a refined academic register.
