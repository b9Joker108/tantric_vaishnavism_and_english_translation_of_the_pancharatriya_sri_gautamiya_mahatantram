# Annotated Bibliography (3A: A-K) of the English translation of the 'Gautamiya Samhita' or 'Gautamiya Mahatantram', a Vaishnava Tantric Pancharatra Agama, with extensive Frontmatter & Introduction #

by Sri Nagahari-dasa Goswamin Avadhutaka
(a.k.a. Beauford A. Stenberg)

**Note:** The (1A & 1B): Frontmatter and extensive Introduction and Survey-of-the-Field the (2A & 2B): Sanskrit original and Hindi commentary, along with annotations, English translation, analysis and commentary, will be complemented by (3A: A - K & 3B: L -Z): this Annotated Bibliography. All three (3) will be progressively and incrementally published in Medium separately, as complimentary living documents, due to publication number-of-word restrictions per published page, according to Medium (online) Webmaster's site policy and the electronic medium, proper. I may also institute (4): An Index of sorts, to collectively house a Table-of-Contents (TOC), and hypertext linkages, to assist ease of electronic navigation and wayfinding, for my audience. I have resolved not to place this work behind a paywall. That said, I reserve the right to review that determination in future, once the work has been well-progressed and well onway to realisation.

## Annotated Bibliography ##

**A first note:** I have taken liberties with the bibliographic details in this work. I have standardised titles of works, authorship, publication details and other saliences, into the somewhat prevalent forms and current standardised conventions of the Anglocentric Romanisation of Indic and Sanskritic languages, amongst others, in English, in order to standardise and normalise for the general reader and to ease and facilitate my electronic filing and discovery of sources. As I have aimed to include as much bibliographic information as possible, which will also function as a literature review of the salient extended discourse in the field; with the aid of the Internet, the true and correct details, should be easily discoverable, for those who require such specifics.

**A second note:** An understanding of the complexities and finesse of a language, is only as good as the dictionary and authoritative sources one has access to, and the direct experience of the language one has received. Of course, English speaking persons who are bilingual in Sanskrit as a second language, tend to use English-Sanskrit bilingual dictionaries, such as Monier-Williams (xxx) and Apte (xxx), amongst others. In my personal methodology, on occasion, I will resort to two (2) voluminous 19th century domestic Indic Sanskritic dictionaries: the 'Vacaspatyam' and the 'Sabdakalpadruma', which stand apart from other such works for their modern style and technique. Both the volumes are replete with quotes from the contemporary literature, in explication of terms, and to attest to their analysis and its veracity. In this respect, they takes proverbial 'leaves out of the book' of 'The Oxford English Dictionary', which in contradistinction, uses direct quotations from historical sources to establish contextualised meaning in the occurrence, and often first attestations of different usages or accretions, around the initial core of the term and it's etymology. Thus charting lexical and semantic polysemy and multivalence. These two voluminous indigenous or domestic Sanskrit dictionaries, may be understood as "a bridge between the dictionary and the encyclopedia", according to 'Sanskrit EBooks \[online]'. Monier and 'Sanskrit Worterbuch' of Oto Bohtlingk and the 'Sanskrit-English Dictionary' by Vamana Sivarama Apte, are the works of excellence in this tradition.

** 'Sabda Kalpadruma': A Comprehensive Sanskrit Dictionary in 5¬†volumes.**

'Sabda Kalpadruma' is a well known Sanskrit lexicon compiled by a few Bengali scholars at the instance of Raja Radhakanta Deb of Bengal. In this compendium, the words have been analyzed into their base-forms and suffixes, their genders determined and their Sanskrit synonyms noted.

Volume 1 Volume 2 Volume 3 Volume 4 Volume 5

**'Vacaspatyam': A Comprehensive Sanskrit Dictionaryin 6¬†volumes.**

'Vacaspatyam' is a Sanskrit Lexicon, of 5442 pages, by Pandit Taranatha Tarkavacaspati, Calcutta. It is very full up to the end of the letter Pa (page 4550), whilst the rest of the alphabet is squeezed into 900 pages! It is said that the Bengali Government, which largely subsidized the undertaking, ordered the protracted endeavour to be curtailed. If that is so, it did a very unwise thing. (Col. GA Jacob in "A Handful Of Popular Maxims Current In Sanskrit Literature")

"Exploring early palm-leaf manuscripts from the NGMPP collection, I came across some rare Vai·π£·πáava Tantras which were hardly known from any other source. In this lecture, I will talk about four of such texts: the SvƒÅyambhuvapa√±carƒÅtra, DevƒÅm·πõta-pa√±carƒÅtra, Jayottaratantra, and the VƒÅsudevakalpa of the MahƒÅlak·π£m·πÉhitƒÅ, which are preserved in palm-leaf manuscripts of the 11‚Äì14th centuries.

The first three texts are earlier than the texts which are regarded until now as the earliest PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra texts. The fourth text, the VƒÅsudevakalpa, is exclusively concerned with the composite form of Lak·π£mƒ´ and VƒÅsudeva, and is comparable to early ≈öƒÅktatantras in certain aspects in its structure and contents. These texts together provide a broader picture of Vai·π£·πáava Tantricism, and suggest that what was happening in the ≈öaiva fold was very similar to what was happening in the Vai·π£·πáava fold."

Ostensibly, this article has nothing to do with tantra. That said, it has both an interesting use of honey and bee metaphorical symbolism in the Vedas and also usefully frames the metaphorical flash of thunderous-lightening in the Brahman-Consciousness. This is useful groundwork to integrate into the traditional usage of the the honey-bee yogin motif of the consummate yogin or avadhuta, especially in the employ of the motif in relation to Sri Dattatreya. The flash of thunderous-lightening and Brahman-Consciousness, is useful for discussions on the Vajra and its employ in the Vajrayana. It is useful to note that the traditional Sanskritic title of Vajracharya, denoted a tantric teacher-adept, not delimited by the specificity of the tantric and esoteric Buddhadharma tradition. This is just a personal note, for later development and integration.

This is an important work. Sri Ramanujacharya is the first attested unambigously theistic Vaishnava Vedantic theologian, known to posterity from the vicissitudes, fickleness and selectivity, of history. It is best to remember that history is a construction, that we can only ever endeavour to approach truth, never reveal or attain it. Since, I became aware that Ramanuja didn't quote from the Shrimad Bhagavatham Mahapuranam, and aware that He authored a commentary on the Sri Vishnu Purana, and that this scripture contains an interior and intimate devotional perspective on the lilas of Sri Govinda and the blessed Gopis, I have become intrigued to find a dedicated work that gives academic treatment on this aspect of Ramanuja and the historicity of the Vedanta. Did Ramanuja have access to the Bhagavatham or not? Was Ramanuja aware of the Bhagavatham? Did Ramanuja just favour the Vishnu Purana over the Bhagavatham, and if so why? Was it something specific to the Vishnu Purana that inflamed and incited Ramanuja's devotional and theistic theology? If so, what?

This work is useful for our purposes, but its aspiration to a scholarly and academic register suffers from being the product of a non-native English speaker and has not been edited by a native English speaker, privy to an appropriate academic and scholarly register and the conventions of academic publishing in English. I also note an inherent and insidious bias in the presentation and framing of matters related to Hindu culture and religion.

This project has many moving parts and a larger auspice.

'Pillar from Gu·πá·π≠upalli: Reign of Nandivarman II, year 4 or 44 \[Ref.: Huma-Num EIAD 164]'. It seems like, when TFB went to do the site inspection for EIAD 164, it could neither be found, nor subquently located with the assistance of the appropriate Indian authorities, which is vexacious and confounding. Also, Griffiths and Tournier in assembing their evergreen online critical edition critical apparatus and architecture, lamented that they were working from commercially published images, for the interested public and not the profesionally produced qualitative upstream ducumentary artefacts and pressings of the inscriptions, used for initial assessement and publication. It seams they have their own evocations of my Apte Dissertation Dilemma!

This volume is exceptional. Though, not ostensibly on tantra in either the Agamic or Sahajiya purview, my fundamental thesis has positioned to the Zeitgeist-of-Bhakti and the Zeitgeist-of-the-Sahajiya, becoming in large and in most evocations, except those prior to the time of Sri Saraha, who opened the Sahajiya Zeitgeist, as conjoint -- and that all modern and contemporary Bhakti evocations, are fundamentally Tantric-Agamic-Sahajiya complexes as they employ tantric architecture and modalities, of the Tantric Agama and Sahajiya sadhana and natural simplicity, without exception.

**Purport:**<br>
I will lean on this volume heavily to support various platforms to defend my questionable perspectives and then problematise the foundation and springboard to newly formed and spontantanously emergent platforms. Then, stabilize and reinforce. I am always engaging the Chatishkoti in formulating positions on a given stance. The Chatushkoti is such a powerful contemplative and investigative architecture and conceptual framework for working through to a triangulated '\[proximate] truth' from a suite of given nodes that are all in a Dharmic processional cascade and epistemologogical relationship to one another. Burchett, I feel and intuit, must have had some sort of federated consortium generating working papers of content under their direction, charter and payment, or conversely, reworked a vast number of their working papers in the field cultivated over some time and with endeavour, for this volume is too vast in its purvey and survey for one person to arguably accomplish. I feel the work has misrepresented the 'North India' of the period in question and uses the contemporary political boundaries of North India, rather than that of the North India of the Greater India, prior to colonization. As a result, their survey is problematic, even as it is exceptional. I condend that this monograph is a watershed work and apart from this volume, I have not encountered a significant body of Burchett's work and as I cultivate, farm and harvest bibliographies on the Dharmic Traditions, as standard, this is of import. On investigation, they have two (2) monographs of standard, this volume and a work on Ch'an I have as yet failed to devour and to which I was not privy. I daresay he would have read my work on the East Mountain Dharma Gate. Burchett has a suite of articles that are most useful: **TODO:** Harvest Burchett in due course. I am going to cite and reference all of the chapters herein Burchett's monograph individually, as I may them easily annotate working notes in relation to where and how I engage them with fidelity, transprency and digital interrogability.

They cite and stand on a 'Tantric Age' but don't interrogate and qualify it. Though they cite, they fail to site their establishement: by taking the auspices and orient to lines-of-sight and then architect according to topology of the discourse and the nature of its environmental flows, processes and process-flows, which should all have been done prior to turning the sod and setting down their bloodied and blessed foundations in a tentatively determined 'Tantric Age'. They commence their building with undue and unsound haste and with no clear manifest and hence, it destabilizes their position and premise from the outset. I feel I intend to proffer a loose sequence of circa five (5) primary -- though likely quite a number more of sub-aspects -- given tantric periods or discrete continua, that in a decentralized way, are related to each other and not necessarily in discrete linear spatio-temporal flows and relationships. I feel that the Himalayan Tantric doxological systems have manifest virtues, as they were the products of many minds, differing perspectives and an indeterminate bounty of hands and yet they are of their own Jyotish's Triumvirate of Time, Place and Circumstance and a given set of 'Causes and Conditions' in the Pratityasamutpada sensibility and require protracted and engaged reworking in order to be positioned well into our presently greater and more substantial perspective from an extensive and ranging discourse of innunerable voices, into a Pan-lineal-inclusivity, of sorts, yet formulated from a contemporary framework and modelling. Digital Humanities: interrogating, visualising and reporting data of given suite of corpora is key. Methodology, yet to be determined.

**Purport:**<br>
It was in incidental reading herein and whilst preparing this citation in passing and rote, that I came to appreciate the accomplished and lyrical wordsmith of Burchett and their artisanal setting of grammar and well-nested and fine *turn-of-phrase* that transcends the mercenary-*cum*-functional humdrum and stock *academic* (NB: collapsed polysemy) register of *rank-and-file* Acad√©mie¬†(annotation: ^‚Ä†) and elevates (or sublimates) the standard reading and prosaic droll of non-fiction, to a beatified and rare pleasure of unexpected poetry: a 'Bhakt\[h]i' *\[arch.]* sensibility [guilt](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=guilt&oldid=85411168#Etymology_4) *\[obs.]* in Old World ['Cr√¶ft'](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=cr%C3%A6ft&oldid=84710142). In contrapuntal, my work is *affected* (NB: collapsed polysemy). Long ago, due to¬†the¬†chicane of Shrimati Serendip\[ity], I game across a hermeneutic filigree and finesse of a Sufi¬†school that reads seven (7) layers of meaning into each orthographic mark, orthographic character, phoneme, lexeme, etc. of the Koran and sacred writings of Their Tradition, and the richness of this transfigured my already palpable awe of Rumi and Ibn Arabi¬†to exultation. I feel this should edify my colonized Colonial constructed 'orthodox' and then dominant recension and re-interpretation of the Vedantic School of Gaudiya Vaishnava siddhanta by Nitya Lila 108 Sri Shrila Bhaktivinode Thakura and His son Nitya Lila 108 Sri Shrila Bhaktivedanta Saraswati Thakura that hold to the literal¬†with unyielding and lacklustre fidelity. At the same time, in the selfsame monograph, I read of the particular and rare 'class' or 'typos' of Sufi holy-person or 'saint', that spontanously recites the glories of a Personage to which they were not directly privy in life, a Personage that had undergone apotheosis¬†and/or a hallowing with a superlative of sanctity that passed (along with Their echelon of accomplishment) from life in obscurity and obfuscation.

**Purport:**<br>
According to the Narayana Swami Parampara devotee Pancharatra Catalogue, this Pancharatra agama is supposed to be on the oldest tier, first set in text in Northern India in the very early mediaeval period from circa 4th century C.E. It has received little-to-no academic treatment in English or any other European language as far as I can ascertain. There is no critical edition and no survey and comparison of manuscripts and the invaluable critical apparatus of the paleographic assessement is yet to be realised. The Sri Bhargava Tantra is also known as the Sri Bhargava Samhita. The name Bhargava suggests that it was composed by Maharshi Bhrigu, but this is not the case. Just as the Pandavas come from Pandu and Kauravas come from Kuru. Similarly, the descendants of Maharshi Bhrigu are called Bhargava, the lineage of Bhrigu. Bhrigu's son was Chyavana. Chyavana's son was Richik. Richik's son was Jamadagni. Jamadagni's son was Bhagavan Sri Parashurama. Parashurama is also called Bhargava as a patronymic in honour of His very great grandsire Maharshi Bhrigu. Parashurama is one of the twenty-four (24) incarnations of Bhagavan Sri Vishnu. This Pancharatra samhita is a dialogue between Maharshi Agastya, who is the questioner or interlocutor and Bhagavan Sri Parashurama, the orator, and it is from Parashurama, also known as Bhargava, that this agama gets its nomenclature. It is not to be conflated with another scripture called Bhargava Samhita orated by Maharshi Bhrigu which is a work of Jyotish Shastra or Vedic Astrology-Astronomy.
