The Śrī Sātvata Saṃhitā, one of the foundational texts of the Pāñcarātra tradition in Vaiṣṇavism, is properly rendered as "Satvata" in transliteration rather than "Sattvata." This distinction arises from a combination of linguistic, etymological, historical, and scholarly factors rooted in Sanskrit orthography and tradition. Below, I enumerate and discourse on all the key reasons, drawing from established sources in Indology and Vaiṣṇava studies. These reasons are interconnected, as the spelling reflects both the word's derivation and its cultural context.

### 1. **Sanskrit Orthography and Phonology**
   The primary reason is the direct spelling in Devanāgarī script: the text's title is सात्वतसंहिता (Sātvatasaṃhitā) or सात्वत-संहिता (Sātvata-saṃhitā). In this, the consonant "t" (त) appears singly after the long vowel "ā" (ा), as "त्व" (tva), without gemination (doubling). In contrast, "sattva" (सत्त्व), meaning "purity" or one of the three guṇas, features a doubled "tt" (त्त्) due to sandhi rules in Sanskrit grammar where "sat" + "tva" results in consonant doubling for phonetic emphasis.

   - **Discourse**: This single "t" ensures the pronunciation is /sɑːtʋətə/, with a smooth transition rather than the emphatic stop in "sattva" (/sət̪t̪ʋə/). Using "Sattvata" would imply an erroneous Devanāgarī like सात्त्वत, which does not appear in original manuscripts or commentaries (e.g., Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa's 19th-century bhāṣya on the text). Scholarly transliteration systems like IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration) standardize it as "Sātvata" to preserve this phonological accuracy, avoiding confusion with words like "sāttvata" (relating to sattva-guṇa). Sources such as Wisdomlib's edition of the Sanskrit text explicitly list variations but prioritize the single-t form, emphasizing that doubling the "t" is a modern mistransliteration, often from non-specialists or inconsistent Romanization.

### 2. **Etymological Derivation from "Satvat" as a Proper Name**
   "Sātvata" derives from "Satvat" (सत्वत्), a patronymic or tribal name in Purāṇic genealogy, referring to an ancestor in the Yadu dynasty (Kr̥ṣṇa's lineage). Satvat was the son of Devakṣatra, and his descendants, the Sātvatas, were a Yadava clan devoted to Vāsudeva (Kr̥ṣṇa). The suffix "-a" (त) forms an adjective meaning "relating to Satvat" or "of the Sātvatas." This is distinct from "sattva," which stems from "sat" (being, truth) + "tva" (abstract noun suffix), involving consonant doubling.

   - **Discourse**: Etymologically, "Sātvata" ties to "sat" (eternal or true), but as a proper noun for a devotional sect, it avoids the morphological rules that double the "t" in abstract terms like "sattva." The Mahābhārata (e.g., Bhīṣma Parva) describes the Sātvatas as adherents of "Sātvata-dharma," a proto-Vaiṣṇava path revealed by Nārāyaṇa, free from rājas and tamas influences. The Saṃhitā is thus "Sātvata" because it embodies the teachings of this eternal (sat) tradition, not a direct reference to the guṇa "sattva." Using "Sattvata" could misleadingly suggest a primary link to the guṇa system rather than the historical clan, as noted in definitions from Sanskrit dictionaries (e.g., sātvataḥ as a name of Viṣṇu or Balarāma). Prabhupāda's commentaries in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam further explain "sātvata" as "eternal," aligning with Vedic literature, not guṇic purity alone.

### 3. **Historical and Sectarian Context in Vaiṣṇava Tradition**
   The text originates from the Sātvata (or Bhāgavata) communities, ancient Vaiṣṇava groups predating the unification with Pāñcarātra around 300–500 CE. As one of the "Three Gems" (alongside Pauṣkara and Jayākhya Saṃhitās), it is classified as "divya" (divine origin), revealed by Nārāyaṇa and propagated by sages like Nārada. Historical references in the Mahābhārata and Purāṇas consistently use "Sātvata" for the sect, not "Sattvata," to denote purity in devotion (bhakti) untainted by passion or ignorance.

   - **Discourse**: In historical development, the Sātvatas trace to Vedic and epic traditions emphasizing Viṣṇu worship. Scholarly dating (e.g., 5th–8th centuries CE) relies on archaic Sanskrit without doubled consonants in proper names. Texts like the Ahirbudhnya Saṃhitā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam refer to "sātvata-saṃhitās" as spotless scriptures equivalent to a fifth Veda. "Sattvata" appears in some modern sources (e.g., Wikipedia) due to anglicized conventions, but this is ahistorical; traditional editions (e.g., Vrajavallabh Dwivedi's) and commentaries by figures like Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa use "Satvata" to maintain sectarian identity. Misusing "Sattvata" risks conflating it with non-devotional guṇa philosophy, diluting its role in Sātvata-dharma as a path of eternal devotion.

### 4. **Scholarly and Editorial Consensus in Indological Sources**
   Major scholarly repositories and editions, such as Wisdomlib, Vaniquotes, and Occult-N-Things publications, uniformly prefer "Satvata" over "Sattvata." This reflects a consensus in Indology to adhere to manuscript evidence, where variations like "Sāttvata" are rare and often dismissed as scribal errors. For instance, the text is regarded as a supreme authority for Nārāyaṇa temple rituals, and its name must preserve authenticity.

   - **Discourse**: In academic works (e.g., Otto Schrader's studies on Pāñcarātra), "Sātvata" is used to distinguish it from later texts influenced by Sāṃkhya (where "sattva" dominates). Modern inconsistencies (e.g., Grokipedia's "Sattvata") stem from phonetic approximations in English, but rigorous transliterations in journals and books (e.g., Brill's ritual studies) favor "Satvata." Editors like Prabhupāda warn against malicious misrepresentations of Pāñcarātra texts, implying that altering to "Sattvata" could be an attempt to secularize or misalign its divine status. Ultimately, "Satvata" upholds the text's sovereignty as a sātvata-saṃhitā—eternal Vedic knowledge—while "Sattvata" introduces unnecessary guṇic connotations.

In summary, these reasons collectively affirm "Satvata" as the accurate rendering, ensuring fidelity to the text's divine, eternal essence in Vaiṣṇava theology. Variations like "Sattvata" are largely modern artifacts, not reflective of the original Sanskrit or tradition.

The Śrī Sātvata Saṃhitā is correctly transliterated as "Sātvata Saṃhitā" (or "Satvata Samhita" in simplified Romanization) rather than "Sattvata Samhita," based on linguistic, textual, and scholarly evidence. The double "tt" in "Sattvata" is a common but erroneous variant that arises from conflation with unrelated terms or inconsistent transliteration practices. Below, I enumerate and discourse on all pertinent reasons, expanding on historical, grammatical, and contextual factors with references to authoritative sources. This addresses potential gaps in prior explanations by incorporating manuscript details, comparative etymology, and modern scholarly consensus.

### 1. **Sanskrit Script and Orthographic Fidelity**
   The original Devanāgarī spelling is सात्वतसंहिता (sātvatasaṃhitā), featuring a single "t" (त) in "त्व" (tva). This avoids the gemination (doubling) seen in words like "sattva" (सत्त्व), where "tt" (त्त्) results from sandhi rules combining "sat" + "tva." Manuscripts and critical editions consistently reflect this single consonant, as doubling would alter the phonetic flow to an unnatural emphasis.

   - **Discourse**: In primary Sanskrit texts, such as those hosted on Wisdomlib, the title is rendered as Sātvatasaṃhitā without doubling, though alternatives like Sāttvatasaṃhitā are noted as variants—likely scribal errors or later interpolations. Phonetically, "Sātvata" is pronounced /sɑːtʋətə/, emphasizing the long "ā" and smooth "tva" transition, whereas "Sattvata" implies /sət̪t̪ʋətə/, which mismatches traditional recitation in Vaiṣṇava rituals. This orthography preserves the text's integrity as a Pāñcarātra Āgama, avoiding confusion with guṇic terminology. Editorial notes in publications, such as those from the Academy of Sanskrit Research, highlight grammatically approved sandhi splits that favor the single "t" to maintain metrical and ritual accuracy.

### 2. **Etymological Origin as a Patronymic Proper Name**
   "Sātvata" derives from "Satvat" (सत्वत्), a proper name denoting a Yadava clan ancestor in the lineage of Kṛṣṇa (Yadu dynasty). The adjectival form "Sātvata" means "pertaining to Satvat" or "of the Sātvatas," a devotional sect. This contrasts with "sattva" (goodness, purity), formed by "sat" (being) + "tva" (abstract suffix), which mandates consonant doubling per Pāṇinian grammar (Aṣṭādhyāyī 8.4.1). As a proper noun, "Satvat" bypasses this rule.

   - **Discourse**: Etymologically, "Satvat" links to "sat" (eternal truth) + "vat" (possessing), forming a name without gemination, as seen in epic references like the Mahābhārata's descriptions of Sātvata-dharma. Using "Sattvata" wrongly implies a direct tie to the Sāṃkhya guṇa "sattva," diluting the text's focus on eternal bhakti. Sanskrit discussions clarify that "satva" (without double t) is a degeminated variant only in improper contexts, but for names like Sātvata, the single "t" is standard to honor its patronymic roots. Prabhupāda's commentaries in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam reinforce "sātvata-saṃhitās" as eternal scriptures, distinct from guṇic abstractions.

### 3. **Historical and Sectarian Identity in Vaiṣṇava Literature**
   The Sātvatas were an ancient Bhāgavata clan (circa 300–500 CE) devoted to Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, and the Saṃhitā embodies their "Sātvata-vidhi" (eternal rites). Historical texts like the Mahābhārata and Purāṇas use "Sātvata" to denote this untainted devotional path, free from rājas/tamas influences. "Sattvata" appears in some modern adaptations but not in core sectarian references, which prioritize the clan's name over guṇic associations.

   - **Discourse**: As one of the "Three Gems" (with Pauṣkara and Jayākhya Saṃhitās), dated around 500 CE, it is classified as "divya" (divine), with Nārāyaṇa as the revealer. Sectarian evolution merged Sātvata with Pāñcarātra, but early usages in texts like Ahirbudhnya Saṃhitā maintain "Sātvata" to signify spotless bhakti. "Sattvata" variants in Wikipedia and similar sources reflect anglicized or eclectic spellings, but traditional Vaiṣṇava scholars (e.g., Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa) use the single-t form to preserve historical purity. This avoids misaligning the text with non-devotional philosophies.

### 4. **Scholarly Consensus and Transliteration Standards**
   Indological standards, including IAST, favor "Sātvata" to match the Sanskrit without artificial doubling. Major editions (e.g., by Vrajavallabh Dwivedi or Bhasyam Swamy) and repositories like Internet Archive, Exotic India, and Vaniquotes uniformly adopt "Satvata," dismissing "Sattvata" as a less accurate alternative.

   - **Discourse**: Scholarly works, such as Otto Schrader's Pāñcarātra studies, use "Sātvata" to differentiate from Sāṃkhya influences. Hindupedia and Amazon listings confirm "Satvata Samhita" as the primary title, with "Sattvata" appearing in casual or erroneous contexts. This consensus stems from manuscript collation, where "Sattvata" is rare and often corrected in critical editions to align with Vedic phonetics.

### 5. **Manuscript Evidence and Editorial Practices**
   Extant manuscripts, including 19th-century commentaries by Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa, show सात्वत (single त), with no doubling in core verses. Editions like the Melkote publication emphasize sandhi splits that reject gemination, treating "Sattvata" as a phonetic approximation in non-native transliterations.

   - **Discourse**: Archival sources reveal that "Sattvata" emerges in later prints due to typesetting errors or influence from similar words like "sattva." Critical editing, as in Dr. Sudhakar Malaviya's work, prioritizes the single "t" for ritual precision, noting that doubling could alter mantra efficacy in temple practices. This practice upholds the text's status as a foundational Pāñcarātra work.

### 6. **Distinction from Related Terms and Avoidance of Conflation**
   "Sattvata" risks conflating the Saṃhitā with "sattva-guṇa," a Sāṃkhya concept unrelated to its devotional core. The text's theology focuses on Vyūha manifestations (e.g., Vāsudeva), not guṇas, so "Satvata" maintains this separation.

   - **Discourse**: Reddit discussions on Sanskrit highlight that "satva" is merely degeminated "sattva," but proper names like Sātvata stand apart. Related texts, like the Sātvata Tantra, use single "t" to emphasize eternal (sat) devotion over purity (sattva). This prevents philosophical misalignment in Hinduism's development.

### 7. **Usage in Broader Vedic and Purāṇic Contexts**
   Cross-references in Purāṇas (e.g., Garuḍa, Brahma) and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam employ "Sātvata" for consistency with Vedic nomenclature, where proper names avoid guṇic doubling. "Sattvata" appears sporadically in regional variants but is not canonical.

   - **Discourse**: In evolutionary studies of Hinduism, "Sātvata" distinguishes Vaiṣṇava sects from Vedic gods, without the phonetic shifts seen in other terms. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam commentaries declare it a "sātvata-saṃhitā," equating it to a fifth Veda, free from modes. This broader usage reinforces the single "t" as the authentic form.

In essence, "Satvata" honors the text's eternal, devotional essence, while "Sattvata" is a variant best avoided for accuracy. This enumeration draws from comprehensive sources to provide a thorough rationale.
