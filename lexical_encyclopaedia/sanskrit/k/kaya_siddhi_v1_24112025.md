Do your best to triangulate all about: 'Kaya Siddhi' please. Academic register, prestige dialect, attested sources.

Kāya Siddhi (कायसिद्धि) is a term rich with layered meanings in Hindu and Buddhist spiritual traditions, denoting the perfected or perfected state of the physical body through advanced yogic, ascetic, or mystical practices. Here is a detailed, academic and prestige-register survey, triangulating classical and contemporary sources across disciplines:

### Core Definition and Etymology

- **Kāya** (काय) means “body” in Sanskrit, often denoting the physical, subtle, or spiritual form of a being.
- **Siddhi** (सिद्धि) means “perfection,” “attainment,” “accomplishment,” or “supernatural power.”
- Thus, **Kāya Siddhi** translates as “Perfection or accomplishment of the body,” implying a state where the body is perfected, purified, immortal, or endowed with special powers [1][2][3].

### Hindu Tradition and Yoga Philosophy

- The **Amṛtasiddhi**, a classical tantric text, defines Kāyasiddhi as the perfected body state attained through tapas (ascetic rigor) involving the purification of impurities and the union of dual bindus (vital energies). It symbolizes the body endowed with all siddhis (powers) at will [1].
- According to the **Patañjalayogaśāstra** (Yoga Sutras), Kāya Siddhi relates to the perfection of the body through tapas and mastery over the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, space) by samyama (meditative absorption) [3].
- Commentators like Bhoja interpret Kāyasiddhi as the ability to manifest the eight great siddhis (Ashta Siddhis) including abilities such as becoming tiny, fly, become heavy, or master material elements—all expressions of bodily perfection [1][2].
- Kāyasiddhi ties in with **kāyakalpa**, the science of bodily rejuvenation and transformation aimed at arresting aging, disease, and death by alchemical and yogic means [4].

### Buddhist Philosophy and Vajrayāna Context

- In Buddhist doctrine, especially Mahayana and Vajrayāna schools, **Kāya Siddhi** parallels concepts of body perfection or transformation, intersecting with teachings on the **Dharmakāya** (body of truth), **Nirmānākāya** (emanation body), and **Sambhogakāya** (bliss body) [5].
- Meditation and yogic practices aim to purify the physical vehicle, leading to states of immortality or radiant transformation, conceptually related to the "Rainbow Body" (Tib. Jalü) phenomenon, often described as attaining **Kāya Siddhi** [6].
- Practices often involve control over prana (life energy), chakras, and subtle body anatomy—linking Kāya Siddhi to mastery over both gross and subtle bodies [4].

### Siddha Tradition and Tamil Siddha Literature

- Siddha practitioners emphasize **Kāya Siddhi** as a high state where the body is not only purified but endowed with supernatural longevity, healing powers, and spiritual realization [4][7].
- The tradition blends alchemy, herbal medicine, and spiritual discipline, seeing the perfected body as the seat of liberation and mystical insight [4].
