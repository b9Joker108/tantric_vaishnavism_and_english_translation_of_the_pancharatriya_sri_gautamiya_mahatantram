# Critical Theory and Theorizing the Pancharatra and Agamic and Sahajiya Tantric Traditions # 

"In modern scholarship on non-modern, and especially non-Western, subjects, we tend to treat the dialectic between orality and literacy as if all theoretical and historical questions in this regard have been answered. After several decades of reconstruction around the problems posed by postcolonialism and postmodernism, we still have a tenacious hold on the idea that whatever is literate or literary is more highly valued than whatever is (“simply”) oral. If a thing is written down, it must be important; and everywhere it is the important and powerful (kings, for example) who first write things down. It is perhaps one of the unfortunate side-effects of the interventions of postmodernism, particularly of Foucauldian thought, that we see power as the essential category of all critique: find the powerful and you will find the essence of a thing or time. However, I have argued elsewhere that we should abandon the distinction between orality and literacy and instead explore the relationship between performance and permanence—and in the process try to avoid the power relations and modern conceits tied up with the idea of literacy. In this essay I make a different argument. I show how a particular logic of practice within an ostensibly written tradition tends to emphasise orality and especially performance, and how this practice institutes a set of formal conventions that resist the static encroachment of literacy, conventions that invite the creativity of live performance. This is an essay that explores how to read a text that resists its own literacy by emphasising its secondary position in relation to performance." This is a direct quote. Amplify it and employ that which it enshrines, to problematise the power and authority of the text set-in-writing, as different to the experiential text of orality-and-performance and their relationships and interpenetrations, to critique Western academic and scholarly bias that persists in Indology and particularly in the presentation and assumptions around the tantric agama tradition, specifically of the Pancharatra. This is introductory reflective and engaged theory for my 'Introduction to the Pancharatra'. Academic register. Prestige dialect and survey from Beginner's mind, but use technical terminology with precision.

# Performing Against Textual Authority: A Poststructuralist Critique of the Pancharatra's Academic Presentation

The fundamental tension between orality and literacy has become a deeply entrenched analytical framework within contemporary scholarship, particularly in Indology and tantric studies. However, this binary distinction, while seemingly neutral and methodological, embodies a hierarchical valuation that privileges the written over the performed, the static over the dynamic, and the permanent over the processual. This hierarchy, far from representing natural epistemological categories, constitutes what poststructuralist analysis reveals as a network of power relations that perpetuate colonial modes of knowledge production and academic authority.

## The Archaeological Problem of Textual Supremacy

The critique articulated above strikes at the heart of a methodological assumption that has calcified into academic orthodoxy: **the presumption that written texts constitute the primary loci of meaning, authority, and cultural significance**[1][2][3]. This assumption operates through what Foucault identifies as discursive formations that establish hierarchies of knowledge production[4][5]. Within the context of tantric studies, and specifically regarding the Pancharatra tradition, this textual supremacy manifests in several problematic ways that demand critical interrogation.

The Western academic approach to Sanskrit literature and tantric traditions has historically privileged the **manuscript as the ultimate repository of religious truth**[6][7]. This privileging operates through what postcolonial theorists identify as orientalist discourse—a system of representations that constructs Eastern traditions through Western epistemological frameworks[8][9]. In the specific case of Pancharatra studies, this manifests as an overwhelming focus on the **Samhitas as written documents**[10][11][12], while systematically marginalizing or entirely ignoring the performative dimensions through which these texts achieve their ritualistic and spiritual efficacy.

The problem extends beyond mere scholarly preference. **The elevation of textual authority over performative practice constitutes what can be termed "epistemic violence"**—a process whereby certain ways of knowing are delegitimized in favor of those that conform to Western academic protocols[13][9]. This violence is particularly acute in tantric studies, where the **lived, embodied, and performed dimensions of practice are precisely what distinguish tantric traditions from purely textual or philosophical systems**[14][15][16].

## Performance as Primary: Deconstructing the Text/Practice Hierarchy

The poststructuralist critique challenges us to recognize that **the relationship between text and performance in the Pancharatra tradition fundamentally inverts the assumptions of Western scholarship**[17][18][19]. Rather than understanding performance as secondary elaboration or "application" of textual authority, we must acknowledge that **the texts themselves emerge from and remain subordinate to performative contexts**[20][21][22].

This inversion is not merely methodological but ontological. **The Pancharatra Agamas exist as performance scripts rather than doctrinal treatises**[10][23][24]. Their authority derives not from their status as written documents but from their capacity to facilitate specific performative encounters with the divine. The texts, in other words, **function as what we might call "performance technologies"**—systematic guides for generating specific kinds of ritualized experience[25][26].

The privileging of textual over performative authority reflects what Jacques Derrida identified as **the "metaphysics of presence"**—the assumption that meaning resides in fixed, identifiable locations rather than emerging through processual, relational activities[27][28]. In the case of the Pancharatra, this metaphysics manifests as the scholarly obsession with **establishing "authentic" textual versions while systematically ignoring the ways in which meaning emerges through ritual performance**[29][30].

## The Colonial Construction of "Hinduism" as Textual Religion

The academic presentation of the Pancharatra tradition operates within the broader context of what Richard King and others have identified as **the colonial construction of "Hinduism" as a world religion**[8][9][31]. This construction involved the systematic privileging of textual sources—particularly Sanskrit texts accessible to European scholars—over the lived, performative, and local traditions that actually constituted the religious landscape of the Indian subcontinent.

**The orientalist emphasis on Sanskrit texts as the "essence" of Indian religion** served specific colonial purposes[6][32][33]. By locating religious authority in textual sources that required specialized linguistic training to access, European scholars positioned themselves as authoritative interpreters of Indian traditions[7][34]. This positioning simultaneously marginalized indigenous practitioners, whose authority derived from performative competence rather than textual scholarship.

The persistence of this textual bias in contemporary Pancharatra studies reflects what **postcolonial theorists term "epistemic colonialism"**—the continued dominance of colonial knowledge frameworks long after political decolonization[3][35][36]. Western scholars continue to approach the Pancharatra primarily through the lens of textual analysis, treating the Samhitas as objects of philological investigation rather than as elements within living performative traditions.

## Towards a Performance-Centered Hermeneutics

The alternative approach suggested by poststructuralist analysis involves **what we might term a "performance-centered hermeneutics"**—an interpretive framework that recognizes performance as the primary site of meaning production[17][19][21]. This approach does not reject textual analysis but rather situates it within the broader performative contexts that give texts their significance and authority.

**Performance-centered hermeneutics recognizes that the Pancharatra tradition operates through what anthropologists call "embodied knowledge"**—forms of understanding that are transmitted through practice rather than textual study[20][26][37]. The elaborate ritual sequences described in the Samhitas achieve their meaning not through textual comprehension but through performative enactment. The practitioner's body becomes the primary site of knowledge production, with texts serving as supplementary guides rather than primary authorities.

This shift in perspective reveals dimensions of the Pancharatra tradition that remain invisible within textual approaches. **The tradition's emphasis on initiation (diksha), for instance, represents a form of knowledge transmission that is fundamentally performative**[14][15][25]. The initiated practitioner gains access to knowledge that cannot be reduced to textual propositions but emerges through specific kinds of embodied practice.

## Resistance and Creative Adaptation

The poststructuralist framework also illuminates the ways in which **the Pancharatra tradition itself resists the colonial imposition of textual authority**. The tradition's persistent emphasis on guru-disciple relationships, on the necessity of proper initiation, and on the inadequacy of textual knowledge without performative competence can be read as forms of resistance to textual colonization[38][3][39].

**The tradition's internal logic consistently subordinates textual to performative authority**. Even the most elaborate textual descriptions of ritual procedures remain incomplete without the embodied knowledge transmitted through direct practice. This incompleteness is not a failure of textual precision but rather a structural feature that preserves the tradition's performative integrity against textual reduction.

Furthermore, **the tradition's capacity for creative adaptation through performance provides resources for resisting academic ossification**[40][26]. Unlike textual traditions that achieve authority through fixity, performative traditions maintain vitality through variation and creative adaptation. Each performative enactment of Pancharatra practice constitutes what we might term a "creative interpretation" that both preserves and transforms the tradition.

## Implications for Contemporary Scholarship

The poststructuralist critique of textual authority in Pancharatra studies has several important implications for contemporary scholarship. First, it demands **a fundamental reconceptualization of what constitutes "data" in the study of tantric traditions**. Rather than focusing exclusively on textual sources, scholars must develop methodologies for engaging with performative dimensions of practice.

Second, **it requires acknowledgment of the limitations of purely textual approaches to understanding living religious traditions**. The meaning of Pancharatra practice cannot be adequately comprehended through textual analysis alone but requires engagement with the performative contexts within which texts achieve significance.

Third, **it suggests the need for collaborative methodologies that recognize indigenous practitioners as authoritative interpreters of their own traditions**. The scholarly habit of treating academic interpretation as superior to practitioner understanding reflects colonial hierarchies of knowledge that contemporary scholarship must actively challenge.

Finally, **the critique opens possibilities for more dynamic and processual approaches to tantric studies**. Rather than treating traditions as fixed systems of belief and practice, scholarship can engage with them as ongoing processes of creative adaptation and performative innovation.

The Pancharatra tradition, properly understood, represents not a textual system requiring scholarly interpretation but a performative technology for generating specific kinds of religious experience. **The tradition's resistance to textual reduction constitutes not a limitation but rather a profound insight into the nature of embodied spiritual practice**. Contemporary scholarship that takes this resistance seriously opens possibilities for more adequate and respectful engagement with the living dimensions of tantric tradition.

This recognition does not diminish the value of textual scholarship but rather situates it within its proper limits. Texts serve the tradition, not the reverse. **The Samhitas achieve their authority through their capacity to facilitate effective performance, not through their status as written documents**. Scholarship that honors this relationship contributes to the tradition's vitality rather than reducing it to academic objects of investigation.

That was very good, further to that, what other elements of Critical Theory, etc., and theorists and discourses of note, should be engaged and invoked re: Pancharatra, Agama, Tantra and Sahajiya traditions?

# Theoretical Frameworks for a Critical Engagement with Pancharatra, Agama, Tantra and Sahajiya Traditions

The preceding analysis of the orality-literacy dialectic opens onto a rich constellation of critical theoretical frameworks that can illuminate the colonial and epistemic violence embedded in Western scholarly approaches to tantric traditions. These theoretical resources provide sophisticated analytical tools for understanding how **knowledge systems, power relations, and embodied practices intersect in the construction and representation of non-Western religious traditions**.

## Phenomenological Approaches to Embodied Spirituality

**Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of embodiment** provides essential theoretical resources for understanding tantric practice as fundamentally grounded in lived bodily experience[1][2][3][4]. His concept of the **"lived body" (corps vécu)** directly challenges the Cartesian mind-body dualism that pervades Western academic approaches to spirituality[5][6]. For Merleau-Ponty, **perception and embodied engagement constitute the primary foundation of knowledge**, preceding and grounding any subsequent intellectual reflection[1][4].

This phenomenological framework proves particularly relevant to tantric traditions, where **embodied practice (sadhana) constitutes the primary epistemological method**. Merleau-Ponty's notion of **"motor intentionality"**—the body's pre-reflective capacity to engage meaningfully with the world—provides a theoretical vocabulary for understanding how tantric practitioners develop embodied knowledge that cannot be reduced to textual propositions[4][7]. **The body-subject's "kinaesthetic consciousness"** offers resources for analyzing the sophisticated somatic techniques that characterize tantric practice[5][4].

Importantly, **Michel Serres' philosophical investigations of corporeal knowledge** extend this phenomenological analysis into explicitly educational and transmissive contexts[8][9][10][11]. Serres argues that **knowledge originates in bodily movement and gesture**, challenging educational systems that privilege abstract cognition over embodied learning[8]. His work on **the "five senses" as philosophical categories** provides frameworks for understanding how tantric traditions develop sophisticated epistemologies grounded in sensory and somatic experience[10][11].

## Feminist Phenomenological Critiques

**Luce Irigaray's feminist phenomenology** offers crucial resources for analyzing the gendered dimensions of academic colonization of tantric traditions[12][13][14][15]. Her critique of **masculine philosophical discourse as fundamentally specular**—constructing women as "mirrors" that reflect male subjectivity—illuminates similar dynamics in Western scholarship's approach to tantric traditions[12][14]. **The privileging of textual over performative authority mirrors the masculine symbolic order's marginalization of feminine ways of knowing**.

Irigaray's concept of **"fluid" versus "solid" epistemologies** proves particularly relevant to tantric studies[12][13]. Her argument that **Western philosophy privileges solid, bounded, penetrative forms of knowledge over fluid, permeable, relational modes** directly parallels the academic bias toward textual "objects" over performative "processes"[14]. **The tantric emphasis on flow, transformation, and relational practice aligns with what Irigaray identifies as feminine epistemological modes**.

**Hélène Cixous' theory of "écriture féminine"** provides additional frameworks for understanding how tantric traditions resist academic textualization[16][17][18][19]. Cixous' call for **writing "from the body" that breaks with masculine discursive norms** parallels tantric traditions' emphasis on embodied rather than purely intellectual transmission[16][19]. Her concept of **"the laugh of the Medusa"** as subversive feminine expression offers models for understanding how tantric practices constitute forms of cultural resistance[16][18].

## Poststructuralist Analytics of Power and Knowledge

**Michel Foucault's analytics of power-knowledge relationships** provide essential tools for analyzing how Western scholarship functions as a form of disciplinary power over tantric traditions[20][21][22][23]. Foucault's concept of **"power-knowledge" (pouvoir-savoir)** reveals how academic authority constitutes itself through particular regimes of truth that systematically marginalize alternative epistemologies[20][21].

**Foucault's analysis of "disciplinary power"** illuminates how academic institutions function to normalize particular approaches to religious studies while pathologizing others[20][22]. His work on **surveillance, examination, and normalization** provides frameworks for understanding how tantric traditions become objects of academic scrutiny that transforms them into "cases" for Western theoretical analysis[22][23].

Crucially, **Foucault's concept of "biopower"** offers resources for analyzing how Western scholarship participates in broader colonial projects of managing and controlling colonized populations[20][21]. **The academic objectification of tantric traditions participates in biopolitical strategies for rendering non-Western populations governable through knowledge production**[22].

## Deconstructive Strategies

**Jacques Derrida's deconstruction** provides methodological resources for dismantling the binary hierarchies that structure Western approaches to tantric traditions[24][25][26][27]. His analysis of **logocentrism—the privileging of speech over writing, presence over absence, identity over difference**—directly applies to the academic privileging of textual over performative dimensions of tantric practice[24][26].

**Derrida's concept of "différance"** offers tools for understanding how tantric traditions operate through deferral, play, and indeterminacy rather than fixed doctrinal positions[24][26]. His critique of **"the metaphysics of presence"** illuminates how Western scholarship seeks to capture tantric "essence" in academic categories that fundamentally misrepresent their processual nature[24][27].

The deconstructive strategy of **"binary reversal followed by displacement"** provides methodological approaches for challenging the text-performance, theory-practice, universal-particular hierarchies that structure tantric studies[24][25]. **Deconstruction's emphasis on "undecidability" offers resources for honoring the irreducible complexity of tantric traditions without reducing them to academic objects**[24].

## Subaltern Studies and Postcolonial Analysis

**Gayatri Spivak's question "Can the Subaltern Speak?"** directly applies to the academic representation of tantric traditions[28][29][30][31]. Her analysis of how **Western academic discourse systematically silences subaltern voices while claiming to represent them** illuminates the colonial dynamics embedded in tantric studies[28][29].

**Spivak's concept of "epistemic violence"** provides frameworks for understanding how Western scholarship participates in the destruction of alternative knowledge systems[28][29][30]. Her analysis of **double colonization—the marginalization of women within already colonized cultures**—proves particularly relevant to tantric traditions that often center feminine principles and practices[29][31].

The broader **Subaltern Studies collective's emphasis on "history from below"** offers methodological alternatives to elite textual approaches[30][32]. **Ranajit Guha's critique of "elitist historiography"** directly applies to the academic focus on prestigious Sanskrit texts while ignoring popular and performative dimensions of tantric practice[30].

## Psychoanalytic Approaches to the Sacred

**Julia Kristeva's theory of abjection** provides sophisticated frameworks for understanding how tantric traditions engage with dimensions of experience that Western culture systematically excludes[33][34][35][36]. Her concept of **the "abject" as that which disrupts stable subject-object boundaries** illuminates tantric practices that deliberately transgress conventional social and psychological categories[33][35].

**Kristeva's analysis of the "maternal chora"** as the pre-symbolic space of embodied meaning offers resources for understanding tantric emphases on pre-linguistic somatic experience[33][35]. Her concept of **"semiotic" versus "symbolic" language** provides tools for analyzing how tantric traditions operate through bodily, rhythmic, and affective modes of communication that resist academic textualization[33][35].

The connection between **abjection and the sacred in Kristeva's analysis** proves particularly relevant to tantric traditions that often work with culturally taboo elements[34][35]. **Her understanding of how the sacred emerges through encounter with the abject** provides frameworks for analyzing tantric practices that deliberately engage with normally excluded dimensions of experience[34].

## Life-Form Analysis

**Giorgio Agamben's concept of "form-of-life"** offers crucial resources for understanding how tantric traditions constitute alternatives to the juridical-political forms of life that characterize Western modernity[37][38][39][40][41]. His distinction between **"bare life" (zoé) and "qualified life" (bios)** illuminates how tantric practices aim to cultivate forms of existence that escape both biological reduction and political capture[37][38].

**Agamben's analysis of Franciscan monasticism as a "form-of-life" that resists incorporation into law** provides methodological models for understanding tantric traditions as alternatives to both religious institutionalization and academic objectification[38][39][40]. His concept of **"use" (usus) as an alternative to ownership** directly parallels tantric understandings of practice as temporary engagement rather than permanent possession[38][39].

## Methodological Integration

These theoretical frameworks converge on several crucial insights for tantric studies:

**First**, they provide sophisticated analyses of how Western academic discourse functions as a form of colonial power that systematically marginalizes alternative epistemologies. **The phenomenological, feminist, poststructuralist, and postcolonial critiques converge on recognizing academic "objectivity" as a particular form of masculine, Western, elite knowledge production that claims universality while excluding other ways of knowing**.

**Second**, they offer methodological alternatives that honor the embodied, performative, and relational dimensions of tantric practice without reducing them to academic objects. **The emphasis on lived experience, fluid boundaries, deconstructive play, subaltern agency, abjection, and forms-of-life provides conceptual resources for engaging with tantric traditions on their own terms**.

**Third**, they reveal how **the academic privileging of textual over performative authority participates in broader patterns of colonial and patriarchal domination**. The feminist critique of masculine epistemology, the postcolonial analysis of epistemic violence, and the deconstructive challenge to binary hierarchies all illuminate how tantric studies reproduces colonial power relations.

**Finally**, these frameworks suggest possibilities for **what Spivak calls "reading against the grain"**—interpretive strategies that honor the agency and resistance embedded in tantric traditions while acknowledging the constraints of academic discourse[29][31]. **Rather than abandoning academic engagement, these approaches suggest ways of working within and against academic institutions to create spaces for more adequate encounters with tantric traditions**.

**The convergence of these critical frameworks provides sophisticated theoretical resources for the kind of methodological transformation that adequate study of tantric traditions requires**. They suggest approaches that honor both the rigor demanded by serious scholarship and the respect required for engaging with living spiritual traditions. **Most importantly, they provide analytical tools for understanding how academic approaches to tantric traditions can either perpetuate colonial violence or contribute to more just and adequate forms of intercultural encounter**.
