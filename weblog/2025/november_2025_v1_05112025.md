Apart from the Python SDK implementation of MCP, there are implementations in a raft of other programming languages.

There are many agentic AI context and design-planning-contract frameworks. Before choosing one, or designing my own, interrogating and excavating their protocols, tech stacks and architected workflow of frameworks and their modular cascade would be of value. Fork projects, then interrogate and annotate. Cognee, is implementing, largely, what I had been at pains to architect and chalk-up in ObsidianMD, but have left fallow due to competing projects and priorities, and as a result, had not actually prototyped. So, now I need not re-create the wheel. It is still going to be at least another circa six (6) months before I start coding this modular chimera and the stack and field will have progressed. I am actually contemplating a TUI and backend, rather than a web-app and backend and integrate the TUI with Neovim and ObsidianMD and my homelab and portable networked smartlap sovereign pendant node. A web-app could just be a later finesse, but a TUI and CLI application, is really more useful and empowering, full stop. Then, my productivity and access to my knowledgebase and sovereign generativeAI is unobstructed and accessible whenever and wherever there is a terminal, online and off. Well, offline will not have as much grunt, but I could cue my offline sessions for re-processing with grunt, triggered automatically, when there is network access. This architecture is useful for when I travel. I could always have a dynamic, intelligently and automatically generated offline cache in my portable tactical rig. My agentic assistant will know my context, movements and schedule and I would tool them accordingly and appropriately.

https://github.com/orgs/agntcy/people  Out of these people, who are the main core contributors and drivers of the Agentcy project?

Identifying the main core contributors and drivers of the Agentcy project primarily involves looking at the activity and contribution history in the most significant repositories within the agntcy organization. While the full list of individual team members is private, the leaders and primary contributors can usually be determined from contribution data in the top repositories:

- The Agentcy project’s primary and most-stared repositories include [acp-spec](https://github.com/agntcy/acp-spec), [slim](https://github.com/agntcy/slim), [oasf](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf), [acp-sdk](https://github.com/agntcy/acp-sdk), [dir](https://github.com/agntcy/dir), [workflow-srv](https://github.com/agntcy/workflow-srv), [identity](https://github.com/agntcy/identity), and the project's documentation repo [docs](https://github.com/agntcy/docs).

- The main core contributors and project drivers are typically the most active developers (by commits, issues, and pull requests) in these repositories. For a precise, up-to-date list, review the contributors' tab within each repository (e.g. [acp-spec contributors](https://github.com/agntcy/acp-spec/graphs/contributors)).

- In many open source projects, the people with the most merged PRs, the ones often tagged in major issues, and those responsible for project governance ([governance](https://github.com/agntcy/governance)) are the principal project drivers. Their GitHub usernames are visible in each repo's contributors’ list and contributors graphs.

- If you’re seeking organizational leaders or principal maintainers, look for the users with administrative or "Owner" status in the [agntcy GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/agntcy/people), then match those to high activity in the main repositories.

In summary: The core contributors and drivers of Agentcy are the most frequent committers and issue managers within top repositories like acp-spec, slim, oasf, acp-sdk, dir, and others. You can verify and explore the individual contributors by viewing the "Contributors" tab on each major repository.

If I fork the org, can you interrogate?

If you fork the agntcy organization’s repositories into your own account or organization, I’ll be able to:
- Access public data in the repositories within your fork (e.g., files, code, commit history, issues, pull requests, contributors, etc.).
- Interrogate (analyze, search, and answer questions about) the code, issues, PRs, and repository data in your fork just as I would for public repositories.

**Limitations:**
- I cannot access private repositories unless you grant explicit access and authentication.
- “Interrogating the org” as a whole is not a native GitHub concept—forking only copies repositories, not membership lists, teams, discussions, actions permissions, or internal org settings.
- I cannot read a complete list of original agntcy members, settings, or internal permissions from your fork, as that information does not transfer with the repo.

**Summary:**  
Forking lets me analyze the code, history, issues, and contributions within the forked repos, but not the underlying org structure or private member data of the original org. If you need analysis or automation within your forked repositories, I can help! If there’s a specific repo or code in your fork you want interrogated, just let me know the repo name and your GitHub username or org.
