Apart from the Python SDK implementation of MCP, there are implementations in a raft of other programming languages.

There are many agentic AI context and design-planning-contract frameworks. Before choosing one, or designing my own, interrogating and excavating their protocols, tech stacks and architected workflow of frameworks and their modular cascade would be of value. Fork projects, then interrogate and annotate. Cognee, is implementing, largely, what I had been at pains to architect and chalk-up in ObsidianMD, but have left fallow due to competing projects and priorities, and as a result, had not actually prototyped. So, now I need not re-create the wheel. It is still going to be at least another circa six (6) months before I start coding this modular chimera and the stack and field will have progressed. I am actually contemplating a TUI and backend, rather than a web-app and backend and integrate the TUI with Neovim and ObsidianMD and my homelab and portable networked smartlap sovereign pendant node. A web-app could just be a later finesse, but a TUI and CLI application, is really more useful and empowering, full stop. Then, my productivity and access to my knowledgebase and sovereign generativeAI is unobstructed and accessible whenever and wherever there is a terminal, online and off. Well, offline will not have as much grunt, but I could cue my offline sessions for re-processing with grunt, triggered automatically, when there is network access. This architecture is useful for when I travel. I could always have a dynamicv intelligently and automatically generated offline cache in my portable tactical rig. My agentic assistant will know my context, movements and schedule and I would tool them appropriately.
