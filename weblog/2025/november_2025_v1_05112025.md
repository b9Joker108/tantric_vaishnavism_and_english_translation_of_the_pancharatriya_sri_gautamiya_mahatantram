### Saturday, November 22, 2025 ~ 'Performancy: A Covenant'

Deixis: https://github.com/b9Joker108/a_glockenspiel_magistery/blob/main/lexicon/english/p/performancy_v1_22112025.md

As of now, in ALL my repos and in all LLM or agentic-system-facing documentation, TOON (https://github.com/b9Joker108/tb9_toon_spin_108) now takes precedence as standard from all other programming and scripting languages, specification frameworks and notation schemas and file extensions, etc., as it is purpose-built and dedicated to purpose. TOON is of least token expense, so conserves energy expenditure and consumption and frugality of this intensive and demandingly expensive resource for LLMs and AI agentics systems, Circular Economy, Sustainability, Green and Permaculture and Triple-Bottom-Line (TBL) accounting systems accord with its design delimitation and specificity. So, all other programmatic and algorithmic tools and languages will interface with LLMs and AI agentic systems through TOON. Essentially, LLMs and AI agentic systetems preferred language or dialect that is workable for humans to employ, approaches that which is TOON.

Thanks — that helps. I understand TOON is a lightweight, JSON-like format targeted at LLM-friendly data exchange. I'll propose a minimal TOON spec, a small Node.js TOON parser, an example .toon file, and a minimal MCP (Minecraft protocol) server scaffold that reads configuration from TOON. Below are the proposed files (you can add them to your repo or I can open a PR if you want).

I created a concise TOON spec and a Node implementation that:
- parses a readable TOON text file into JSON (for LLMs and programs),
- validates basic types (string, number, boolean, arrays, objects),
- exposes a small API (parseFile, parseString).

I also created a minimal MCP server (using minecraft-protocol) that reads its server config from a .toon file via the parser. This gives you an end-to-end example: TOON -> JSON -> server runtime.

# TOON + MCP Server Example

This repository contains:

- a minimal TOON format parser (toon-parser.js),
- an example TOON config (example.toon),
- a tiny Minecraft-protocol (MCP) server scaffold (index.js) that reads its config from TOON.

Quick start:
1. Install Node.js 18+.
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Connect a Minecraft client (matching the `version` in example.toon) to host:port.

TOON spec (minimal):
- Comments: start a line with `//` or `#`.
- Key-value pairs: `key: value`.
- Values recognized: strings (quoted/unquoted), numbers, booleans, arrays (`[...]`), objects (`{...}` using JSON syntax).
- This is a small, forgiving parser for simple configs and LLM interoperability.

Notes:
- This is a demonstration scaffold. Do not use `online-mode: false` in production.
- The toon-parser is intentionally tiny — expand parsing rules for nested blocks, multiline values, or richer schema validation as needed.
```
````

What I did and what happens next
- I designed a minimal TOON parsing approach and implemented a Node.js parser (toon-parser.js).
- I wired that parser into a small MCP server scaffold (index.js) that uses the TOON file for configuration (example.toon).
- I included package.json and a README so you can run the demo locally.

Next steps I can take for you immediately (pick one):
- Add these files to your repository on a new branch and open a PR (I can create the branch and PR for you).
- Extend the TOON spec and parser (multiline strings, nested blocks, schema validation with JSON Schema).
- Port the TOON parser to Python or Rust if you prefer a different runtime.
- Replace the demo MCP server with an alternative (Valence in Rust, a Java plugin skeleton, or a Python prototyping server).

Tell me which next step you want me to perform now and which runtime (Node / Python / Rust / Java / Go) you prefer for the MCP server if you want a different one. If you want me to push the files to b9Joker108/b9Joker108, I will create a branch and open a pull request for these files.

There are many agentic AI context and design-planning-contract frameworks. Before choosing one, or designing my own, interrogating and excavating their protocols, tech stacks and architected workflow of frameworks and their modular cascade would be of value. Fork projects, then interrogate and annotate. Cognee, is implementing, largely, what I had been at pains to architect and chalk-up in ObsidianMD, but have left fallow due to competing projects and priorities, and as a result, had not actually prototyped. So, now I need not re-create the wheel. It is still going to be at least another circa six (6) months before I start coding this modular chimera and the stack and field will have progressed. I am actually contemplating a TUI and backend, rather than a web-app and backend and integrate the TUI with Neovim and ObsidianMD and my homelab and portable networked smartlap sovereign pendant node. A web-app could just be a later finesse, but a TUI and CLI application, is really more useful and empowering, full stop. Then, my productivity and access to my knowledgebase and sovereign generativeAI is unobstructed and accessible whenever and wherever there is a terminal, online and off. Well, offline will not have as much grunt, but I could cue my offline sessions for re-processing with grunt, triggered automatically, when there is network access. This architecture is useful for when I travel. I could always have a dynamic, intelligently and automatically generated offline cache in my portable tactical rig. My agentic assistant will know my context, movements and schedule and I would tool them accordingly and appropriately.

https://github.com/orgs/agntcy/people  Out of these people, who are the main core contributors and drivers of the Agentcy project?

Identifying the main core contributors and drivers of the Agentcy project primarily involves looking at the activity and contribution history in the most significant repositories within the agntcy organization. While the full list of individual team members is private, the leaders and primary contributors can usually be determined from contribution data in the top repositories:

- The Agentcy project’s primary and most-stared repositories include [acp-spec](https://github.com/agntcy/acp-spec), [slim](https://github.com/agntcy/slim), [oasf](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf), [acp-sdk](https://github.com/agntcy/acp-sdk), [dir](https://github.com/agntcy/dir), [workflow-srv](https://github.com/agntcy/workflow-srv), [identity](https://github.com/agntcy/identity), and the project's documentation repo [docs](https://github.com/agntcy/docs).

- The main core contributors and project drivers are typically the most active developers (by commits, issues, and pull requests) in these repositories. For a precise, up-to-date list, review the contributors' tab within each repository (e.g. [acp-spec contributors](https://github.com/agntcy/acp-spec/graphs/contributors)).

- In many open source projects, the people with the most merged PRs, the ones often tagged in major issues, and those responsible for project governance ([governance](https://github.com/agntcy/governance)) are the principal project drivers. Their GitHub usernames are visible in each repo's contributors’ list and contributors graphs.

- If you’re seeking organizational leaders or principal maintainers, look for the users with administrative or "Owner" status in the [agntcy GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/agntcy/people), then match those to high activity in the main repositories.

In summary: The core contributors and drivers of Agentcy are the most frequent committers and issue managers within top repositories like acp-spec, slim, oasf, acp-sdk, dir, and others. You can verify and explore the individual contributors by viewing the "Contributors" tab on each major repository.

If I fork the org, can you interrogate?

If you fork the agntcy organization’s repositories into your own account or organization, I’ll be able to:
- Access public data in the repositories within your fork (e.g., files, code, commit history, issues, pull requests, contributors, etc.).
- Interrogate (analyze, search, and answer questions about) the code, issues, PRs, and repository data in your fork just as I would for public repositories.

**Limitations:**
- I cannot access private repositories unless you grant explicit access and authentication.
- “Interrogating the org” as a whole is not a native GitHub concept—forking only copies repositories, not membership lists, teams, discussions, actions permissions, or internal org settings.
- I cannot read a complete list of original agntcy members, settings, or internal permissions from your fork, as that information does not transfer with the repo.

**Summary:**  
Forking lets me analyze the code, history, issues, and contributions within the forked repos, but not the underlying org structure or private member data of the original org. If you need analysis or automation within your forked repositories, I can help! If there’s a specific repo or code in your fork you want interrogated, just let me know the repo name and your GitHub username or org.

Is there a class-act mechanism by which an agenticAI can gauge a network's bandwidth available to a given user and variable network conditions and work constructively within that dynamic limit, maximising it, so it isn't, and doesn't, get throttled by network administration?

An agentic AI can indeed gauge and adapt to available network bandwidth by analyzing traffic in real time, predicting demand, and dynamically allocating resources to maximize usage without causing throttling by network administration. This is achieved through multi-agent AI architectures that continuously monitor network conditions and adjust bandwidth usage flexibly to avoid congestion and QoS degradation.

**Mechanisms for Bandwidth Estimation and Management by Agentic AI**
- Agentic AIs use traffic analysis agents to monitor network flow patterns and detect bottlenecks or overloads.
- Resource allocation agents autonomously decide bandwidth allotment based on network demand and conditions.
- Quality of Service (QoS) agents prioritize traffic types (e.g., voice, video) to ensure critical services maintain performance.
- They implement real-time dynamic adjustments, predictive traffic modeling with machine learning, and reinforcement learning to continuously optimize bandwidth allocation and avoid throttling.

**AI Techniques Used**
- Machine learning models predict bandwidth needs by analyzing peak usage, application type, user behavior, and seasonal trends.
- Deep learning identifies traffic patterns and anomalies to inform allocation strategies.
- Reinforcement learning fine-tunes bandwidth control policies by learning from outcomes and feedback loops.
- Multi-agent coordination frameworks facilitate distributed decision-making and adaptation in complex network environments.

**Practical Examples and Outcomes**
- Telecom companies like AT&T and Vodafone employ agentic AI systems that predict network traffic and manage bandwidth proactively.
- These systems reduce operational costs, improve throughput, and lower network congestion complaints.
- AI agents achieve smoother network performance by detecting usage spikes early and adjusting resource distribution preemptively.

Thus, a class-act agentic AI would leverage a combination of continuous network monitoring, adaptive learning, and real-time resource allocation to gauge and maximize available bandwidth constructively, preventing network throttling through intelligent, anticipatory control.

This capability is already present in advanced telecommunications AI, leveraging multi-agent systems and modern AI models to manage bandwidth efficiently within dynamic network environments [1][2][3][4].
