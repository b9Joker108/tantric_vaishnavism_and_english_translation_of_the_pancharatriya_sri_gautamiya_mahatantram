Apart from the Python SDK implementation of MCP, there are implementations in a raft of other programming languages.

There are many agentic AI context and design-planning-contract frameworks. Before choosing on, or designing my own, interrogating and excavating their protocols, tech stacks and workflow of frameworks and their modular cascade would be of value. Fork projects, then interrogate and annotate. Cognee, is implementing, largely, what I had been at pains to architect and chalk-up in ObsidianMD, but have left fallow due to competing projects and priorities, and as a result, had not actually prototyped. So, now I need not re-create the wheel. It is still going to be at least another circa six (6) months before I start coding this modular chimera. I am actually contemplating a TUI and backend, rather than a web-app and backend and integrate the TUI with Neovim and ObsidianMD and my homelab and portable networked smartlap sovereign pendant node. Then, my productivity and access to my knowledgebase and sovereign gene$ativeAI is unobstructed and accessible wherever there is a terminal, online and off.
