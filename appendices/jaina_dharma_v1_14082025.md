# The Early Tradition of Deity Worship in Jainism: The Jivantasvami-Pratima and Its Intersections with Pancharatra and Vaikhanasa Practices

---

## Introduction

The study of **deity worship traditions in India** necessitates a close look at their ritual origins, philosophical underpinnings, and artistic expressions. Among the most intriguing yet under-explored phenomena is the **Jivantasvami-pratima** of the Śvetāmbara Jain tradition: images of Mahavira, and occasionally other Tirthankaras, depicted as royal personages and, according to tradition, carved during their own lifetimes. This concept, as referenced in such works as the commentaries on the Jain Agamas, Hemachandra’s *Trishashtishalakapurushacharita*, and the art-historical research of Dr. U.P. Shah—particularly concerning the Akota bronze hoard—offers crucial insights into Jain liturgical history. At the same time, the broader landscape of **deity worship in Hinduism**, especially the Pancharatra and Vaikhanasa systems, provides both points of contrast and evidence of regional artistic and theological dialogue.

How did the tradition of the **jivantasvami-pratima** emerge, and what is its historical validity? What do the Akota bronzes and the Osian temple images reveal about the development and extension of this Jain iconographical idiom? More broadly, how do Jain and Hindu (especially Vaishnava) deity worship traditions intersect, diverge, and mutually inform each other, both in theology and artistic production? This report investigates these central questions through the lenses of textual tradition, archaeological discovery, art history, and the interplay of regional religious movements.

## Svetambara Agamic References to Jivantasvami-Pratima

The earliest Jain canonical texts—the **Agamas** or Angas—compiled through the oral tradition by Mahavira’s Ganadharas and later by Srut-kevalis, do not mention the **Jivantasvami-pratima** explicitly. The main religious texts for the Śvetāmbara sect, which retains the tradition of the jivantasvami image, include eleven main Angas and associated texts, but the concept of a portrait image of the Tirthankara while alive is absent from foundational works like the *Kalpasutra* or the *Paumacariu* of Vimalasuri (5th century CE)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://atozwiki.com/Jain_Agamas_%28%C5%9Av%C4%93t%C4%81mbara%29?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/jain-literature/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

Notably, references to Jivantasvami-pratima surface in later Śvetāmbara commentarial literature, beginning from the **mid-6th century CE**. Key texts include:

- **Vasudevahindi** (Samghadasagani, c. mid 6th century CE)
- **Avashyakachurni** (c. 625 CE)
- **Avashyakavritti** (Haribhadra Suri, c. 750 CE)
- **Trishashtishalakapurushacharita** (Hemachandra, 1169–1172 CE)

These texts mention the existence of such images at prominent ancient centers such as Ujjain, Dashapura, Vidisha, Vitabhayapattana, Puri, and Koshala[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jivantasvami?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44143087.pdf?addFooter=false&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4"). The motif is that of the Tirthankara, especially Mahavira, depicted while still a royal prince (hence bejeweled and crowned), standing in the **kayotsarga** pose—characteristic of meditative abandonment of the body.

It is significant that these images are particular to the Śvetāmbara tradition and are **unknown in the Digambara Jain tradition**, highlighting early sectarian divergences in Jain image worship and theological interpretation[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jivantasvami?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

Later Śvetāmbara works, including the *Prabandhakosha* (Rajashekhara, 1348) and *Kalpapradipa* (Jinaprabhasuri, 1335), further mention ceremonial processions and worship of such images, reflecting the growing ritual and social importance of the jivantasvami-pratima concept in medieval Western India[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://jainqq.org/explore/006774/370?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44143087.pdf?addFooter=false&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4").

## Hemachandra’s Account of the Jivantasvami Tradition

In *Trishashtishalakapurushacharita*, Hemachandra delves deeply into the narrative and legendary aspects of the jivantasvami image. He tells of the construction of the original image by Vidyunmali, a god, in sandalwood—crafted during Mahavira’s time as a prince, about a year before his renunciation**[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.wisdomlib.org/jainism/book/trishashti-shalaka-purusha-caritra?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jivantasvami?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")**. The tale describes the image as being the object of royal devotion, particularly by the queen of Udayana of Vitabhaya. The original sculpture is said to have been installed at Vidisha but ultimately lost.

Hemachandra further relates the legend of the Chaulukya emperor Kumarapala (c. 1135–1175), who, through devout actions and excavations, recovered the jivantasvami image at Vitabhayapattana. Such stories serve both to authenticate the antiquity of the image tradition and to elevate the status of the jivantasvami-pratima as an object of extraordinary spiritual and historical continuity, even as textual references to actual practice remain distinctly post-canonical in origin[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44143087.pdf?addFooter=false&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4").

## Dr. U.P. Shah’s Research and the Akota Jivantasvami Images

The most substantial archaeological evidence for early Jain image worship, and for the tradition of the jivantasvami-pratima in particular, comes from discoveries associated with the **Akota hoard of bronzes** near Baroda (Vadodara), Gujarat[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.128592/2015.128592.Akota-Bronzes_djvu.txt?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akota_Bronzes?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "8")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://historyofvadodara.in/akota-bronzes/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Jivantasvami?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "10")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-Indian-bronze?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11"). Uncovered before 1951 and systematically studied by Dr. U.P. Shah, the Akota bronzes represent a series of small-scale, but highly significant sculptures dating predominantly from the 6th through 12th centuries CE.

Among these are two images, both **datable to the early and mid-6th century**, which have been authoritatively identified as Jivantasvami Mahavira. These bronzes are **especially significant** for several reasons:

- **Inscriptional Evidence**: One image bears an inscription identifying it explicitly as Jivantasvami, installed by Nagisvari.
- **Stylistic Features**: Both images display Mahavira, crowned and decked in royal ornaments, standing in the kayotsarga posture, with a benign countenance and meditative serenity.
- **Dating**: The paleographic and iconographic analysis places these works in the early Gupta period, corroborated by the style of dress, jewelry, and modeling[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.128592/2015.128592.Akota-Bronzes_djvu.txt?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-Indian-bronze?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11").
- **Artistic Techniques**: The bronzes employ the cire-perdue (lost wax) casting technique, with inlays of silver and copper for added detail—a hallmark of early Western Indian bronze work[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-Indian-bronze?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://chaseacademy.in/indian-bronze-sculpture/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").
- **Theological Implications**: The Akota bronzes, and their *Jivantasvami* iconography, provide the strongest material proof for the practice of image installation—and perhaps even worship—of Mahavira or other Jinas as living, royal personages[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jivantasvami?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

These finds substantiate Dr. U.P. Shah’s thesis that the **Jivantasvami-pratima tradition**, while not referenced in the earliest Agamic texts, took tangible form by the early medieval period, with a lineage that might plausibly reach back in oral or legendary form to the time of Mahavira[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://historyofvadodara.in/akota-bronzes/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.128592/2015.128592.Akota-Bronzes_djvu.txt?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7").

## Archaeological and Artistic Evidence: Akota and Osian

The **Akota** site (ancient Ankottaka) was a major center of Jainism from at least the 5th century CE. The **hoard** discovered here comprises 68 images, most of which are Jain, including several *jivantasvami* figures, images of other Tirthankaras, and attendant divinities. These works are widely distributed among prestigious museums worldwide (Baroda, National Museum New Delhi, MET New York, Honolulu)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akota_Bronzes?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "8")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://historyofvadodara.in/akota-bronzes/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-Indian-bronze?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11"). Dated based on inscriptions and paleographic style, the Akota bronzes span from the 5th to the 12th centuries, though the most critical *jivantasvami* examples are from the 6th century.

The **Osian Mahavira Jain temple** in Rajasthan, built in the late 8th century and renovated many times through the 12th century, preserves additional iconographic evidence. Among its treasures are three large (5.7 feet) images labeled as *jivantasvami*, two of which are virtually identical, with at least one explicitly inscribed as Rishabhanatha, dating to 1044 CE[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jivantasvami?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3"). Like their Akota analogs, these sculptures depict the Tirthankara as a majestic, crowned figure in kayotsarga, surrounded by divine attendants and elaborate architectural frames—including introductory elements such as torana archways, yaksha-yakshi (male and female nature deities), mahavidyas, and minor Jina figures.

A noteworthy development shown in Osian and subsequent sites is the **extension** of the *jivantasvami* iconography to other Tirthankaras besides Mahavira—e.g., Rishabhanatha, Sumatinatha, Chandraprabha, Shitalanatha, Shantinath, Munisuvrata, and Parshvanatha—as evidenced by several inscribed images from the 11th to 15th centuries CE[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://jainqq.org/explore/006774/370?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44143087.pdf?addFooter=false&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jivantasvami?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

## Iconographic Features of Jivantasvami Images

The **defining iconographic feature** of the *jivantasvami-pratima* is the depiction of the Tirthankara in royal attire—crowned (mukuta), adorned with necklaces, girdle, garlands, and anklets, dressed in a long dhoti and standing in the classic **kayotsarga mudra**: erect, with both hands extended down to the knees, expressive of meditative detachment and self-control.

Additional markers frequently include:

- **Shrivatsa mark** on the chest, particularly in later Western Indian images.
- **Padmapitha (lotus seat)**, nimbus, and ornamental torana arches, especially in larger temple sculptures.
- **Attendant figures**—yakshas and yakshis, mahavidyas, and minor Jinas—populate the elaborate parikara (iconographic frame), particularly in Osian examples, marking a shift towards more populist or lay-friendly, devotional iconography in the medieval period[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44143087.pdf?addFooter=false&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://jainqq.org/explore/006774/370?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5").
- In rare instances, lateral strands of hair (associated with Rishabhanatha) are represented in the *jivantasvami* form, signaling both iconographical cross-pollination and the adaptation of the concept beyond Mahavira.

The **Akota bronzes** are smaller and intended for private or monastic worship, in contrast to the monumental stone images of Osian. Both exemplify the early Western Indian school of art, which, while rooted in the Gupta idiom, evolved its own precise decorative vocabulary as Jain temple culture matured[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-Indian-bronze?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.128592/2015.128592.Akota-Bronzes_djvu.txt?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jivantasvami?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

## Theological Foundations and Evolution of Image Worship in Jainism

**Jain worship** is fundamentally focused not on a creator god or transactional deity, but on the veneration of enlightened teachers—the Tirthankaras—who have achieved perfect knowledge (kevala jnana) and offer a model of spiritual emancipation through self-effort[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://jainsattva.com/jain-stories/what-do-jains-worship/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "13"). What, then, is the place of images like the *jivantasvami-pratima*?

- According to legend, the **making and worship of Mahavira’s image while alive (hence “jivanta”)** transmits the message that a human can attain godlike status through inner austerity—a concept both exemplary and didactic[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44143087.pdf?addFooter=false&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4").
- Canonical Jain philosophy is, on the surface, deeply aniconic and suspicious of idol worship for its attachment to the material world. Yet, image worship emerged early in both Śvetāmbara and Digambara Jainism, particularly as a means to transmit virtues and spiritual qualities of the Tirthankara. Over time, rituals such as puja and festivals (e.g., Rathayatra) came to surround the images[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://jainsattva.com/jain-stories/what-do-jains-worship/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "13").
- The **appearance of living images** (Jivantasvami) may represent an attempt to respond to the devotional (bhakti) currents of the time, signaling a convergence of theologically complex views and pragmatic liturgical practices in the region.

The **broadened representation** of other Jinas as *jivantasvami* in Western India from the 10th century onwards suggests a shift towards a more populous, devotional, and accessible visual language—paralleling, and perhaps responding to, the growth of Hindu bhakti movement and the increasingly elaborate ritual temple cultures[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44143087.pdf?addFooter=false&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://jainqq.org/explore/006774/370?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5").

## Pancharatra and Vaikhanasa: Vaishnava Deity Worship and Its Context

### The Pancharatra Agamas

The **Pancharatra tradition** is a major sect of Vaishnavism, emerging as early as the 3rd century BCE and systematized by the turn of the Common Era. Its core texts, the Pancharatra Agamas (including *Ahirbudhnya Samhita*, *Paushkara Samhita*, *Paramasamhita*, etc.), provide **detailed ritual and metaphysical blueprints** for the worship of Vishnu and his various forms[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://sameedh.com/pancharatra-agamas/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "14")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://archive.org/details/pancaratra-agamas?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "15").

Key features include:

- **Five Modes of Worship**: Para (transcendent being), Vyuha (emanations), Vibhava (avataric forms), Antaryami (indwelling presence), Archavatara (manifestation via the consecrated image).
- **Temple Construction and Ritual**: Elaborate prescriptions for temple design, consecration, daily and festival rituals, with a focus on the *archavatara*—the deity’s manifest presence in a murti.
- **Bhakti (Devotion)**: Pancharatra texts explicitly enjoin loving surrender and service as the path to grace and liberation—a distinct hallmark compared to the more meditative, non-theistic approach of Jainism[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://hindu.mythologyworldwide.com/the-teachings-of-the-narada-pancharatra-a-guide-to-bhakti-and-ritual/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "16").

### The Vaikhanasa Agamas

The **Vaikhanasa tradition**, tracing its origins to the sage Vikhanasa, is another foundational branch of **Vaishnava temple ritual**, emphasizing Vedic sacrifice, priestly lineage, and daily ritual order. The Vaikhanasa Agamas elaborate on every nuance of **idol construction, installation (pratishtha), daily worship (nitya-karman), festival conduct**, and the holistic architecture of the temple as a microcosm of the cosmos[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://kaalchakra.in/vaikhanasa-agamas-preserving-divine-rituals-and-worship/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "17")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://sameedh.com/vaikhanasa-agamas/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "18")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.vedadhara.com/vaikhanasa-agama?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "19").

Key components include:

- **Five-Fold Worship**: Mirroring the Pancharatra schema but typically with greater focus on Vedic sacrificial elements.
- **Emphasis on Ritual Purity**: The priesthood is highly codified and hereditary.
- **Temple Architecture**: Strong focus on standardized garbhagriha (sanctum) and hierarchical layout.
- **Vishnu as Central Deity**: All worship revolves around various manifestations of Vishnu, often accompanied by consorts and symbolic attendants.

### Commonalities and Contrasts with Jain Tradition

While both Jain and Vaishnava groups constructed monumental temples and developed networks of pilgrimage, the **theological core diverges**:

- **Jainism**: Focuses on the realization of self-perfection and the absence of a creator god; images represent realized humans (Tirthankaras), not divine actors.
- **Vaishnavism**: Worships Vishnu as a supreme, personal god who manifests for the deliverance of the world; image is ritually invoked as a living embodiment of the divine.

Practically, the prominence of regional interaction and shared patronage led to **iconographical and artistic parallels** (especially in Western India, Gujarat, Rajasthan), as is visible in similar aesthetics, pose conventions, and even ornamentation among Jain and Vaishnava bronzes of the Gupta and post-Gupta periods[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-Indian-bronze?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.indianetzone.com/indian_bronze_sculptures?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "20")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://chaseacademy.in/indian-bronze-sculpture/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").

## Comparative Iconography and Artistic Parallels

From the **5th to 12th centuries**, Western India was one of the main crucibles of Indian bronze-casting, and the technical and stylistic prowess of Akota bronzework influenced both Jain and Vaishnava image production[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-Indian-bronze?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11"). Typical features shared across sects and traditions include:

- **Cire-perdue (lost wax) technique**: Employed in both Jain and Hindu images.
- **Inlay of precious metals**: Eyes and ornaments highlighted with silver, copper, or gold.
- **Standardized poses**: Standing (kayotsarga in Jainism, anantasayana or other mudras in Vaishnavism), meditative expressions, inscribed details.
- **Royal accouterments**: Crowns, elaborate jewelry, and garments adorn both Jinas and Vishnu images, though with different theological symbolism.
- **Miniature scale and temple portability**: Many images were designed for private or monastic worship—a possible mark of lay and monastic engagement in both faiths.

Art historians note the convergence of motifs—ornate haloes, use of architectural frames, and narrative reliefs—as evidence that **guild workshops** often served both Jain and Hindu patrons, fostering “syncretic traditions” especially in Gujarat and Rajasthan[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://globusedujournal.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GPE-142-JD24-10-Ekta-Malik.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "21")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://jainqq.org/explore/006774/370?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5").

## Historical Interactions and Interreligious Dialogue

By the medieval period, especially between the 10th and 15th centuries, **Gujarat, Rajasthan, and parts of neighboring regions were characterized by overlapping communities of Jains and Vaishnavas**[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://ivsjournal.com/index.php/files/article/view/1?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "22")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://globusedujournal.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GPE-142-JD24-10-Ekta-Malik.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "21"). This cohabitation produced:

- **Shared sacred spaces**: Temples, pilgrimage routes, and marketplace shrines where rituals and festivals drew multiple communities.
- **Mutual artistic influence**: Stone carvers, bronze casters, and architects employed similar techniques and occasionally hybrid iconographies.
- **Syncretic theological formulations**: While core beliefs remained distinct (Jain non-theism and individual self-effort versus Vaishnava theism and divine grace), devotional practices and social rituals often echoed each other.

Scholars highlight the **fluidity of religious identity**—witnessed in architectural borrowings, narrative adaptations (e.g., Jain versions of Hindu epics), and the development of pluralistic regional identities and composite artistic vocabularies[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://globusedujournal.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GPE-142-JD24-10-Ekta-Malik.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "21")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://ivsjournal.com/index.php/files/article/view/1?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "22"). Social and historical pressures, including the rise of Bhakti and Sufi devotional movements, further encouraged religious openness and cross-borrowing.

## Theological Reflections: Bhakti, Austerity, and Image Veneration

The **contrast between Jain and Vaishnava ritual** is profound in doctrinal terms, yet both traditions participated in the Indian evolution from sacrifice and abstraction to contemplative and devotional interiority:

- **Jainism**: Worship is directed not to an external god for aid, but to perfected teachers (Tirthankaras) whose images are meditated upon as models of inner austerity and achieved knowledge[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://jainsattva.com/jain-stories/what-do-jains-worship/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "13"). Rituals—when present—are intended to focus attention on renunciation, non-attachment, and non-violence, with the *jivantasvami* as an exception expressing both lay devotion and the recognition of virtue in ordinary life.
- **Vaishnavism (Pancharatra/Vaikhanasa)**: Centers on the personal presence of God in the image, ritual offerings, music, chant, and hospitality to the deity. **Bhakti**—devotional surrender—is both the means and the end of spiritual life, with a rich ritual structure encompassing public and private worship, daily liturgies, and extravagant festival rites[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://hindu.mythologyworldwide.com/the-teachings-of-the-narada-pancharatra-a-guide-to-bhakti-and-ritual/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "16").

**Yet, both traditions converge** in the use of images/temples as mediators of virtue, sites of collective memory, and foci for community ritual. In the process, both adapted to, and shaped, wider Indian modes of religious art and practice.

## The Legacy of Jivantasvami-Pratima in Modern Scholarship and Practice

The **Jivantasvami-pratima** are of enduring importance for several interrelated reasons:

- **Art historical context**: They are pivotal in dating and tracing the development of bronze sculpture in India, marking the ascendance of the Western Indian school and its technological and stylistic dialogue with larger North and South Indian traditions[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-Indian-bronze?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.indianetzone.com/indian_bronze_sculptures?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "20")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://chaseacademy.in/indian-bronze-sculpture/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").
- **Theological negotiation**: Their existence attests to an ongoing tension and reconciliation between Jain aniconism and popular devotional needs, opening a window onto the ways that Indian religions adapt and evolve in response to communal dynamics.
- **Social and regional identity**: The overlap of Jain and Vaishnava artistic forms, the shared sites and craftsmen, and intertwined patronage mark them as emblems of a distinctive “Gujarat-Rajasthan” synthesis with echoes in ongoing syncretism and regional pluralism.

In contemporary India, the Osian Mahavira temple and Akota bronzes remain pilgrimage and tourist sites, visited by both devotees and scholars. Jain communities continue to reflect on the meaning of image worship in their practice, and the *jivantasvami-pratima* stand as a testament to the flexibility and creativity at the heart of Indian religion.

## Conclusion

The **early tradition of Jain deity worship**—culminating in the jivantasvami-pratima—represents a convergence of philosophical aspiration, ritual response, and artistic innovation. Textual evidence from Śvetāmbara canon and post-canonical commentaries, archaeological discoveries like the Akota bronzes, and the visual grandeur of Osian’s monumental images collectively illuminate the evolution of Jain ritual and art.

When compared to the **Pancharatra and Vaikhanasa Vaishnava practices**, the jivantasvami-pratima emerges not as an isolated phenomenon, but as a participant in a regional religious ecosystem marked by dialogue, mutual influence, and creative adaptation—where fierce doctrinal differences sit alongside shared social worlds, common artistic vocabularies, and evolving religious experience.

Their study offers a model for understanding **how early and medieval Indian religions negotiated the claims of tradition and the demands of practice**, and how art, text, and community continually co-create vital, living spiritual traditions.
